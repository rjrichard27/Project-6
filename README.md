# Project-6
This repository contains all of the words in The Bell Jar by Sylvia Plath. It also contains a txt file with word counts of all of the words and some explatory data analysis.
All of the code is written using CoLab while the graph of the word frequencies was made in QuickStart. The hello.py file also does a sentiment analysis on the first part of the first chapter.
