              "'Chapter One\\n\\nIt was a queer, sultry summer, the summer they electrocuted the\\nRosenbergs, and I didn\\'t know what I was doing in New York.  I\\'m stupid\\nabout executions.  The idea of being electrocuted makes me sick, and\\nthat\\'s all there was to read about in the papers--goggle-eyed headlines\\nstaring up at me on every street corner and at the fusty,\\npeanut-smelling mouth of every subway.  It had nothing to do with me,\\nbut I couldn\\'t help wondering what it would be like, being burned alive\\nall along your nerves.\\n\\nI thought it must be the worst thing in the world.\\n\\nNew York was bad enough.  By nine in the morning the fake, country-wet\\nfreshness that somehow seeped in overnight evaporated like the tail end\\nof a sweet dream.  Mirage-grey at the bottom of their granite canyons,\\nthe hot streets wavered in the sun, the car tops sizzled and glittered,\\nand the dry, tindery dust blew into my eyes and down my throat.\\n\\nI kept hearing about the Rosenbergs over the radio and at the office\\ntill I couldn\\'t get them out of my mind.  It was like the first time I\\nsaw a cadaver.  For weeks afterwards, the cadaver\\'s head--or what there\\nwas left of it--floated up behind my eggs and bacon at breakfast and\\nbehind the face of Buddy Willard, who was responsible for my seeing it\\nin the first place, and pretty soon I felt as though I were carrying\\nthat cadaver\\'s head around with me on a string, like some black,\\nnoseless balloon stinking of vinegar.\\n\\nI knew something was wrong with me that summer, because all I could\\nthink about was the Rosenbergs and how stupid I\\'d been to buy all those\\nuncomfortable, expensive clothes, hanging limp as fish in my closet,\\nand how all the little successes I\\'d totted up so happily at college\\nfizzled to nothing outside the slick marble and plate-glass fronts\\nalong Madison Avenue.\\n\\nI was supposed to be having the time of my life.\\n\\nI was supposed to be the envy of thousands of other college girls just\\nlike me all over America who wanted nothing more than to be tripping\\nabout in those same size seven patent leather shoes I\\'d bought in\\nBloomingdale\\'s one lunch hour with a black patent leather belt and\\nblack patent leather pocket-book to match.  And when my picture came\\nout in the magazine the twelve of us were working on--drinking martinis\\nin a skimpy, imitation silver-lamé bodice stuck on to a big, fat cloud\\nof white tulle, on some Starlight Roof, in the company of several\\nanonymous young men with all-American bone structures hired or loaned\\nfor the occasion--everybody would think I must be having a real whirl.\\n\\nLook what can happen in this country, they\\'d say.  A girl lives in some\\nout-of-the-way town for nineteen years, so poor she can\\'t afford a\\nmagazine, and then she gets a scholarship to college and wins a prize\\nhere and a prize there and ends up steering New York like her own\\nprivate car.\\n\\nOnly I wasn\\'t steering anything, not even myself.  I just bumped from\\nmy hotel to work and to parties and from parties to my hotel and back\\nto work like a numb trolley-bus.  I guess I should have been excited\\nthe way most of the other girls were, but I couldn\\'t get myself to\\nreact.  I felt very still and very empty, the way the eye of a tornado\\nmust feel, moving dully along in the middle of the surrounding\\nhullabaloo.\\n\\n\\nThere were twelve of us at the hotel.\\n\\nWe had all won a fashion magazine contest, by writing essays and\\nstories and poems and fashion blurbs, and as prizes they gave us jobs\\nin New York for a month, expenses paid, and piles and piles of free\\nbonuses, like ballet tickets and passes to fashion shows and hair\\nstylings at a famous expensive salon and chances to meet successful\\npeople in the field of our desire and advice about what to do with our\\nparticular complexions.\\n\\nI still have the make-up kit they gave me, fitted out for a person with\\nbrown eyes and brown hair: an oblong of brown mascara with a tiny\\nbrush, and a round basin of blue eye-shadow just big enough to dab the\\ntip of your finger in, and three lipsticks ranging from red to pink,\\nall cased in the same little gilt box with a mirror on one side.  I\\nalso have a white plastic sun-glasses case with coloured shells and\\nsequins and a green plastic starfish sewed on to it.\\n\\nI realized we kept piling up these presents because it was as good as\\nfree advertising for the firms involved, but I couldn\\'t be cynical.  I\\ngot such a kick out of all those free gifts showering on to us.  For a\\nlong time afterwards I hid them away, but later, when I was all right\\nagain, I brought them out, and I still have them around the house.  I\\nuse the lipsticks now and then, and last week I cut the plastic\\nstarfish off the sun-glasses case for the baby to play with.\\n\\nSo there were twelve of us at the hotel, in the same wing on the same\\nfloor in single rooms, one after the other, and it reminded me of my\\ndormitory at college.  It wasn\\'t a proper hotel--I mean a hotel where\\nthere are both men and women mixed about here and there on the same\\nfloor.\\n\\nThis hotel--the Amazon--was for women only, and they were mostly girls\\nmy age with wealthy parents who wanted to be sure their daughters would\\nbe living where men couldn\\'t get at them and deceive them; and they\\nwere all going to posh secretarial schools like Katy Gibbs, where they\\nhad to wear hats and stockings and gloves to class, or they had just\\ngraduated from places like Katy Gibbs and were secretaries to\\nexecutives and junior executives and simply hanging around in New York\\nwaiting to get married to some career man or other.\\n\\nThese girls looked awfully bored to me.  I saw them on the sun-roof,\\nyawning and painting their nails and trying to keep up their Bermuda\\ntans, and they seemed bored as hell.  I talked with one of them, and\\nshe was bored with yachts and bored with flying around in aeroplanes\\nand bored with skiing in Switzerland at Christmas and bored with the\\nmen in Brazil.\\n\\nGirls like that make me sick.  I\\'m so jealous I can\\'t speak.  Nineteen\\nyears, and I hadn\\'t been out of New England except for this trip to New\\nYork.  It was my first big chance, but here I was, sitting back and\\nletting it run through my fingers like so much water.\\n\\nI guess one of my troubles was Doreen.\\n\\nI\\'d never known a girl like Doreen before.  Doreen came from a society\\ngirls\\' college down South and had bright white hair standing out in a\\ncotton candy fluff round her head and blue eyes like transparent agate\\nmarbles, hard and polished and just about indestructible, and a mouth\\nset in a sort of perpetual sneer.  I don\\'t mean a nasty sneer, but an\\namused, mysterious sneer, as if all the people around her were pretty\\nsilly and she could tell some good jokes on them if she wanted to.\\n\\nDoreen singled me out right away.  She made me feel I was that much\\nsharper than the others, and she really was wonderfully funny.  She\\nused to sit next to me at the conference table, and when the visiting\\ncelebrities were talking she\\'d whisper witty sarcastic remarks to me\\nunder her breath.\\n\\nHer college was so fashion-conscious, she said, that all the girls had\\npocket-book covers made out of the same material as their dresses, so\\neach time they changed their clothes they had a matching pocket-book.\\nThis kind of detail impressed me.  It suggested a whole life of\\nmarvellous, elaborate decadence that attracted me like a magnet.\\n\\nThe only thing Doreen ever bawled me out about was bothering to get my\\nassignments in by a deadline.\\n\\n\\'What are you sweating over that for?\\'  Doreen lounged on my bed in a\\npeach silk dressing-gown, filing her long, nicotine-yellow nails with\\nan emery board, while I typed up the draft of an interview with a\\nbest-selling novelist.\\n\\nThat was another thing--the rest of us had starched cotton summer\\nnighties and quilted housecoats, or maybe terry-towel robes that\\ndoubled as beachcoats, but Doreen wore these full-length nylon and lace\\njobs you could half see through, and dressing-gowns the colour of skin,\\nthat stuck to her by some kind of electricity.  She had an interesting,\\nslightly sweaty smell that reminded me of those scallopy leaves of\\nsweet fern you break off and crush between your fingers for the musk of\\nthem.\\n\\n\\'You know old Jay Cee won\\'t give a damn if that story\\'s in tomorrow or\\nMonday.\\'  Doreen lit a cigarette and let the smoke flare slowly from\\nher nostrils so her eyes were veiled.  \\'Jay Cee\\'s ugly as sin,\\' Doreen\\nwent on coolly.  \\'I bet that old husband of hers turns out all the\\nlights before he gets near her or he\\'d puke otherwise.\\'\\n\\nJay Cee was my boss, and I liked her a lot, in spite of what Doreen\\nsaid.  She wasn\\'t one of the fashion magazine gushers with fake\\neyelashes and giddy jewellery.  Jay Cee had brains, so her plug-ugly\\nlooks didn\\'t seem to matter.  She read a couple of languages and knew\\nall the quality writers in the business.\\n\\nI tried to imagine Jay Cee out of her strict office suit and\\nluncheon-duty hat and in bed with her fat husband, but I just couldn\\'t\\ndo it.  I always had a terribly hard time trying to imagine people in\\nbed together.\\n\\nJay Cee wanted to teach me something, all the old ladies I ever knew\\nwanted to teach me something, but I suddenly didn\\'t think they had\\nanything to teach me.  I fitted the lid on my typewriter and clicked it\\nshut.\\n\\nDoreen grinned.  \\'Smart girl.\\'\\n\\nSomebody tapped at the door.\\n\\n\\'Who is it?\\'  I didn\\'t bother to get up.\\n\\n\\'It\\'s me, Betsy.  Are you coming to the party?\\'\\n\\n\\'I guess so.\\'  I still didn\\'t go to the door.\\n\\nThey imported Betsy straight from Kansas with her bouncing blonde\\npony-tail and Sweetheart-of-Sigma-Chi smile.  I remember once the two\\nof us were called over to the office of some blue-chinned TV producer\\nin a pin-stripe suit to see if we had any angles he could build up for\\na programme, and Betsy started to tell about the male and female corn\\nin Kansas.  She got so excited about that damn corn even the producer\\nhad tears in his eyes, only he couldn\\'t use any of it, unfortunately,\\nhe said.\\n\\nLater on, the Beauty Editor persuaded Betsy to cut her hair and made a\\ncover girl out of her, and I still see her face now and then, smiling\\nout of those \\'P.Q.\\'s wife wears B.H. Wragge\\' ads.\\n\\nBetsy was always asking me to do things with her and the other girls as\\nif she were trying to save me in some way.  She never asked Doreen.  In\\nprivate, Doreen called her Pollyanna Cowgirl.\\n\\n\\'Do you want to come in our cab?\\' Betsy said through the door.\\n\\nDoreen shook her head.\\n\\n\\'That\\'s all right, Betsy,\\' I said.  \\'I\\'m going with Doreen.\\'\\n\\n\\'Okay.\\'  I could hear Betsy padding off down the hall.\\n\\n\\'We\\'ll just go till we get sick of it,\\' Doreen told me, stubbing out\\nher cigarette in the base of my bedside reading-lamp, \\'then we\\'ll go\\nout on the town.  Those parties they stage here remind me of the old\\ndances in the school gym.  Why do they always round up Yalies?  They\\'re\\nso stoo-pit!\\'\\n\\nBuddy Willard went to Yale, but now I thought of it, what was wrong\\nwith him was that he was stupid.  Oh, he\\'d managed to get good marks\\nall right, and to have an affair with some awful waitress on the Cape\\nby the name of Gladys, but he didn\\'t have one speck of intuition.\\nDoreen had intuition.  Everything she said was like a secret voice\\nspeaking straight out of my own bones.\\n\\n\\nWe were stuck in the theatre-hour rush.  Our cab sat wedged in back of\\nBetsy\\'s cab and in front of a cab with four of the other girls, and\\nnothing moved.\\n\\nDoreen looked terrific.  She was wearing a strapless white lace dress\\nzipped up over a snug corset affair that curved her in at the middle\\nand bulged her out again spectacularly above and below, and her skin\\nhad a bronzy polish under the pale dusting-powder.  She smelled strong\\nas a whole perfume store.\\n\\nI wore a black shantung sheath that cost me forty dollars.  It was part\\nof a buying spree I had with some of my scholarship money when I heard\\nI was one of the lucky ones going to New York.  This dress was cut so\\nqueerly I couldn\\'t wear any sort of a bra under it, but that didn\\'t\\nmatter much as I was skinny as a boy and barely rippled, and I liked\\nfeeling almost naked on the hot summer nights.\\n\\nThe city had faded my tan, though.  I looked yellow as a Chinaman.\\nOrdinarily, I would have been nervous about my dress and my odd colour,\\nbut being with Doreen made me forget my worries.  I felt wise and\\ncynical as all hell.\\n\\nWhen the man in the blue lumber shirt and black chinos and tooled\\nleather cowboy boots started to stroll over to us from under the\\nstriped awning of the bar where he\\'d been eyeing our cab, I didn\\'t have\\nany illusions.  I knew perfectly well he\\'d come for Doreen.  He\\nthreaded his way out between the stopped cars and leaned engagingly on\\nthe sill of our open window.\\n\\n\\'And what, may I ask, are two nice girls like you doing all alone in a\\ncab on a nice night hike this?\\'\\n\\nHe had a big, wide, white tooth-paste-ad smile.\\n\\n\\'We\\'re on our way to a party,\\' I blurted, since Doreen had gone\\nsuddenly dumb as a post and was fiddling in a blasé way with her white\\nlace pocket-book cover.\\n\\n\\'That sounds boring,\\' the man said.  \\'Whyn\\'t you both join me for a\\ncouple of drinks in that bar over there?  I\\'ve some friends waiting as\\nwell.\\'\\n\\nHe nodded in the direction of several informally dressed men slouching\\naround under the awning.  They had been following him with their eyes,\\nand when he glanced back at them, they burst out laughing.\\n\\nThe laughter should have warned me.  It was a kind of low, know-it-all\\nsnicker, but the traffic showed signs of moving again, and I knew that\\nif I sat tight, in two seconds I\\'d be wishing I\\'d taken this gift of a\\nchance to see something of New York besides what the people on the\\nmagazine had planned out for us so carefully.\\n\\n\\'How about it, Doreen?\\' I said.\\n\\n\\'How about it, Doreen?\\' the man said, smiling his big smile.  To this\\nday I can\\'t remember what he looked like when he wasn\\'t smiling.  I\\nthink he must have been smiling the whole time.  It must have been\\nnatural for him, smiling like that.\\n\\n\\'Well, all right,\\' Doreen said to me.  I opened the door, and we\\nstepped out of the cab just as it was edging ahead again and started to\\nwalk over to the bar.\\n\\nThere was a terrible shriek of brakes followed by a dull thump-thump.\\n\\n\\'Hey you!\\'  Our cabby was craning out of his window with a furious,\\npurple expression.  \\'Waddaya think you\\'re doin\\'?\\'\\n\\nHe had stopped the cab so abruptly that the cab behind bumped smack\\ninto him, and we could see the four girls inside waving and struggling\\nand scrambling up off the floor.\\n\\nThe man laughed and left us on the kerb and went back and handed a bill\\nto the driver in the middle of a great honking and some yelling, and\\nthen we saw the girls from the magazine moving off in a row, one cab\\nafter another, like a wedding party with nothing but bridesmaids.\\n\\n\\'Come on, Frankie,\\' the man said to one of his friends in the group,\\nand a short, scrunty fellow detached himself and came into the bar with\\nus.\\n\\nHe was the type of fellow I can\\'t stand.  I\\'m five feet ten in my\\nstocking feet, and when I am with little men I stoop over a bit and\\nslouch my hips, one up and one down, so I\\'ll look shorter, and I feel\\ngawky and morbid as somebody in a side-show.\\n\\nFor a minute I had a wild hope we might pair off according to size,\\nwhich would line me up with the man who had spoken to us in the first\\nplace, and he cleared a good six feet, but he went ahead with Doreen\\nand didn\\'t give me a second look.  I tried to pretend I didn\\'t see\\nFrankie dogging along at my elbow and sat close by Doreen at the table.\\n\\nIt was so dark in the bar I could hardly make out anything except\\nDoreen.  With her white hair and white dress she was so white she\\nlooked silver.  I think she must have reflected the neons over the bar.\\nI felt myself melting into the shadows like the negative of a person\\nI\\'d never seen before in my life.\\n\\n\\'Well, what\\'ll we have?\\' the man asked with a large smile.\\n\\n\\'I think I\\'ll have an Old-Fashioned,\\' Doreen said to me.\\n\\nOrdering drinks always floored me.  I didn\\'t know whisky from gin and\\nnever managed to get anything I really liked the taste of.  Buddy\\nWillard and the other college boys I knew were usually too poor to buy\\nhard liquor or they scorned drinking altogether.  It\\'s amazing how many\\ncollege boys don\\'t drink or smoke.  I seemed to know them all.  The\\nfarthest Buddy Willard ever went was buying us a bottle of Dubonnet,\\nwhich he only did because he was trying to prove he could be æsthetic\\nin spite of being a medical student.\\n\\n\\'I\\'ll have a vodka,\\' I said.\\n\\nThe man looked at me more closely.  \\'With anything?\\'\\n\\n\\'Just plain,\\' I said.  \\'I always have it plain.\\'\\n\\nI thought I might make a fool of myself by saying I\\'d have it with ice\\nor soda or gin or anything.  I\\'d seen a vodka ad once, just a glass\\nfull of vodka standing in the middle of a snowdrift in a blue light,\\nand the vodka looked clear and pure as water, so I thought having vodka\\nplain must be all right.  My dream was some day ordering a drink and\\nfinding out it tasted wonderful.\\n\\nThe waiter came up then, and the man ordered drinks for the four of us.\\nHe looked so at home in that citified bar in his ranch outfit I thought\\nhe might well be somebody famous.\\n\\nDoreen wasn\\'t saying a word, she only toyed with her cork place-mat and\\neventually lit a cigarette, but the man didn\\'t seem to mind.  He kept\\nstaring at her the way people stare at the great white macaw in the\\nzoo, waiting for it to say something human.\\n\\nThe drinks arrived, and mine looked clear and pure, just like the vodka\\nad.\\n\\n\\'What do you do?\\' I asked the man, to break the silence shooting up\\naround me on all sides, thick as jungle grass.  \\'I mean what do you do\\nhere in New York?\\'\\n\\nSlowly and with what seemed a great effort, the man dragged his eyes\\naway from Doreen\\'s shoulder.  \\'I\\'m a disc jockey,\\' he said.  \\'You\\nprob\\'ly must have heard of me.  The name\\'s Lenny Shepherd.\\'\\n\\n\\'I know you,\\' Doreen said suddenly.\\n\\n\\'I\\'m glad about that, honey,\\' the man said, and burst out laughing.\\n\\'That\\'ll come in handy.  I\\'m famous as hell.\\'\\n\\nThen Lenny Shepherd gave Frankie a long look.\\n\\n\\'Say, where do you come from?\\' Frankie asked, sitting up with a jerk.\\n\\'What\\'s your name?\\'\\n\\n\\'This here\\'s Doreen.\\'  Lenny slid his hand around Doreen\\'s bare arm and\\ngave her a squeeze.\\n\\nWhat surprised me was that Doreen didn\\'t let on she noticed what he was\\ndoing.  She just sat there, dusky as a bleached blonde negress in her\\nwhite dress and sipped daintily at her drink.\\n\\n\\'My name\\'s Elly Higginbottom,\\' I said.  \\'I come from Chicago.\\'  After\\nthat I felt safer.  I didn\\'t want anything I said or did that night to\\nbe associated with me and my real name and coming from Boston.\\n\\n\\'Well, Elly, what do you say we dance some?\\'\\n\\nThe thought of dancing with that little runt in his orange suede\\nelevator shoes and mingy T-shirt and droopy blue sports coat made me\\nlaugh.  If there\\'s anything I look down on, it\\'s a man in a blue\\noutfit.  Black or grey, or brown, even.  Blue just makes me laugh.\\n\\n\\'I\\'m not in the mood,\\' I said coldly, turning my back on him and\\nhitching my chair over nearer to Doreen and Lenny.\\n\\nThose two looked as if they\\'d known each other for years by now.\\nDoreen was spooning up the hunks of fruit at the bottom of her glass\\nwith a spindly silver spoon, and Lenny was grunting each time she\\nlifted the spoon to her mouth, and snapping and pretending to be a dog\\nor something, and trying to get the fruit off the spoon.  Doreen\\ngiggled and kept spooning up the fruit.\\n\\nI began to think vodka was my drink at last.  It didn\\'t taste like\\nanything, but it went straight down into my stomach like a\\nsword-swallower\\'s sword and made me feel powerful and god-like.\\n\\n\\'I better go now,\\' Frankie said, standing up.\\n\\nI couldn\\'t see him very clearly, the place was so dim, but for the\\nfirst time I heard what a high, silly voice he had.  Nobody paid him\\nany notice.\\n\\n\\'Hey, Lenny, you owe me something.  Remember, Lenny, you owe me\\nsomething, don\\'t you, Lenny?\\'\\n\\nI thought it odd Frankie should be reminding Lenny he owed him\\nsomething in front of us, and we being perfect strangers, but Frankie\\nstood there saying the same thing over and over until Lenny dug into\\nhis pocket and pulled out a big roll of green bills and peeled one off\\nand handed it to Frankie.  I think it was ten dollars.\\n\\n\\'Shut up and scram.\\'\\n\\nFor a minute I thought Lenny was talking to me as well, but then I\\nheard Doreen say \\'I won\\'t come unless Elly comes\\'.  I had to hand it to\\nher the way she picked up my fake name.\\n\\n\\'Oh, Elly\\'ll come, won\\'t you, Elly?\\' Lenny said, giving me a wink.\\n\\n\\'Sure I\\'ll come,\\' I said.  Frankie had wilted away into the night, so I\\nthought I\\'d string along with Doreen.  I wanted to see as much as I\\ncould.\\n\\nI liked looking on at other people in crucial situations.  If there was\\na road accident or a street fight or a baby pickled in a laboratory jar\\nfor me to look at, I\\'d stop and look so hard I never forgot it.\\n\\nI certainly learned a lot of things I never would have learned\\notherwise this way, and even when they surprised me or made me sick I\\nnever let on, but pretended that\\'s the way I knew things were all the\\ntime.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter Two\\n\\nI wouldn\\'t have missed Lenny\\'s place for anything.\\n\\nIt was built exactly like the inside of a ranch, only in the middle of\\na New York apartment house.  He\\'d had a few partitions knocked down to\\nmake the place broaden out, he said, and then had them pine-panel the\\nwalls and fit up a special pine-panelled bar in the shape of a\\nhorseshoe.  I think the floor was pine-panelled, too.\\n\\nGreat white bearskins lay about underfoot, and the only furniture was a\\nlot of low beds covered with Indian rugs.  Instead of pictures hung up\\non the walls, he had antlers and buffalo horns and a stuffed rabbit\\nhead.  Lenny jutted a thumb at the meek little grey muzzle and stiff\\njackrabbit ears.\\n\\n\\'Ran over that in Las Vegas.\\'\\n\\nHe walked away across the room, his cowboy boots echoing like pistol\\nshots.  \\'Acoustics,\\' he said, and grew smaller and smaller until he\\nvanished through a door in the distance.\\n\\nAll at once music started to come out of the air on every side.  Then\\nit stopped, and we heard Lenny\\'s voice say \\'This is your twelve o\\'clock\\ndisc jock, Lenny Shepherd, with a round-up of the tops in pops.  Number\\nTen in the wagon train this week is none other than that little\\nyaller-haired gal you been hearin\\' so much about lately ... the one an\\'\\nonly Sunflower?\\n\\n  _I was born in Kansas, I was bred in Kansas,\\n  And when I marry I\\'ll be wed in Kansas..._\\n\\n\\n\\'What a card!\\' Doreen said.  \\'Isn\\'t he a card?\\'\\n\\n\\'You bet,\\' I said.\\n\\n\\'Listen, Elly, do me a favour.\\'  She seemed to think Elly was who I\\nreally was by now.\\n\\n\\'Sure,\\' I said.\\n\\n\\'Stick around, will you?  I wouldn\\'t have a chance if he tried anything\\nfunny.  Did you see that muscle?\\'  Doreen giggled.\\n\\nLenny popped out of the back room.  \\'I got twenty grand\\'s worth of\\nrecording equipment in there.\\' He ambled over to the bar and set out\\nthree glasses and a silver ice-bucket and a big pitcher and began to\\nmix drinks from several different bottles.\\n\\n  _...to a true-blue gal who promised she would wait--\\n  She\\'s the sunflower of the Sunflower State._\\n\\n\\n\\'Terrific, huh?\\'  Lenny came over, balancing three glasses.  Big drops\\nstood out on them like sweat, and the ice-cubes jingled as he passed\\nthem round.  Then the music twanged to a stop, and we heard Lenny\\'s\\nvoice announcing the next number.\\n\\n\\'Nothing like listening to yourself talk.  Say,\\' Lenny\\'s eye lingered\\non me, \\'Frankie vamoosed, you ought to have somebody, I\\'ll call up one\\nof the fellers.\\'\\n\\n\\'That\\'s okay,\\' I said.  \\'You don\\'t have to do that.\\'  I didn\\'t want to\\ncome straight out and ask for somebody several sizes larger than\\nFrankie.\\n\\nLenny looked relieved.  \\'Just so\\'s you don\\'t mind.  I wouldn\\'t want to\\ndo wrong by a friend of Doreen\\'s.\\'  He gave Doreen a big white smile.\\n\\'Would I, honeybun?\\'\\n\\nHe held out a hand to Doreen, and without a word they both started to\\njitterbug, still hanging on to their glasses.\\n\\nI sat cross-legged on one of the beds and tried to look devout and\\nimpassive like some businessmen I once saw watching an Algerian\\nbelly-dancer, but as soon as I leaned back against the wall under the\\nstuffed rabbit, the bed started to roll out into the room, so I sat\\ndown on a bearskin on the floor and leaned back against the bed instead.\\n\\nMy drink was wet and depressing.  Each time I took another sip it\\ntasted more and more like dead water.  Around the middle of the glass\\nthere was painted a pink lasso with yellow polka dots.  I drank to\\nabout an inch below the lasso and waited a bit, and when I went to take\\nanother sip, the drink was up to lasso-level again.\\n\\nOut of the air Lenny\\'s ghost voice boomed, \\'_Wye oh wye did I ever\\nleave Wyoming_?\\n\\nThe two of them didn\\'t even stop jitterbugging during the intervals.  I\\nfelt myself shrinking to a small black dot against all those red and\\nwhite rugs and that pine-panelling.  I felt like a hole in the ground.\\n\\nThere is something demoralizing about watching two people get more and\\nmore crazy about each other, especially when you are the only extra\\nperson in the room.\\n\\nIt\\'s like watching Paris from an express caboose heading in the\\nopposite direction--every second the city gets smaller and smaller,\\nonly you feel it\\'s really you getting smaller and smaller and lonelier\\nand lonelier, rushing away from all those lights and that excitement at\\nabout a million miles an hour.\\n\\nEvery so often Lenny and Doreen would bang into each other and kiss and\\nthen swing back to take a long drink and close in on each other again.\\nI thought I might just lie down on the bearskin and go to sleep until\\nDoreen felt ready to go back to the hotel.\\n\\nThen Lenny gave a terrible roar.  I sat up.  Doreen was hanging on to\\nLenny\\'s left earlobe with her teeth.\\n\\n\\'Leggo, you bitch!\\'\\n\\nLenny stooped, and Doreen went flying up on to his shoulder, and her\\nglass sailed out of her hand in a long, wide arc and fetched up against\\nthe pine-panelling with a silly tinkle.  Lenny was still roaring and\\nwhirling round so fast I couldn\\'t see Doreen\\'s face.\\n\\nI noticed, in the routine way you notice the colour of somebody\\'s eyes,\\nthat Doreen\\'s breasts had popped out of her dress and were swinging out\\nslightly like full brown melons as she circled belly-down on Lenny\\'s\\nshoulder, thrashing her legs in the air and screeching, and then they\\nboth started to laugh and slow up, and Lenny was trying to bite\\nDoreen\\'s hip through her skirt when I let myself out the door before\\nanything more could happen and managed to get downstairs by leaning\\nwith both hands on the banister and half sliding the whole way.\\n\\nI didn\\'t realize Lenny\\'s place had been air-conditioned until I wavered\\nout on to the pavement.  The tropical, stale heat the sidewalks had\\nbeen sucking up all day hit me in the face like a last insult.  I\\ndidn\\'t know where in the world I was.\\n\\nFor a minute I entertained the idea of taking a cab to the party after\\nall, but decided against it because the dance might be over by now, and\\nI didn\\'t feel like ending up in an empty barn of a ballroom strewn with\\nconfetti and cigarette-butts and crumpled cocktail napkins.\\n\\nI walked carefully to the nearest street corner, brushing the wall of\\nthe buildings on my left with the tip of one finger to steady myself.\\nI looked at the street sign.  Then I took my New York street map out of\\nmy pocket-book.  I was exactly forty-three blocks by five blocks away\\nfrom my hotel.\\n\\nWalking has never fazed me.  I just set out in the right direction,\\ncounting the blocks under my breath, and when I walked into the lobby\\nof the hotel I was perfectly sober and my feet only slightly swollen,\\nbut that was my own fault because I hadn\\'t bothered to wear any\\nstockings.\\n\\nThe lobby was empty except for a night clerk dozing in his lit booth\\namong the key-rings and the silent telephones.\\n\\nI slid into the self-service elevator and pushed the button for my\\nfloor.  The doors folded shut like a noiseless accordion.  Then my ears\\nwent funny, and I noticed a big, smudgy-eyed Chinese woman staring\\nidiotically into my face.  It was only me, of course.  I was appalled\\nto see how wrinkled and used-up I looked.\\n\\nThere wasn\\'t a soul in the hall.  I let myself into my room.  It was\\nfull of smoke.  At first I thought the smoke had materialized out of\\nthin air as a sort of judgement, but then I remembered it was Doreen\\'s\\nsmoke and pushed the button that opened the window vent.  They had the\\nwindows fixed so you couldn\\'t really open them and lean out, and for\\nsome reason this made me furious.\\n\\nBy standing at the left side of the window and laying my cheek to the\\nwoodwork, I could see downtown to where the UN balanced itself in the\\ndark, like a weird, green, Martian honeycomb.  I could see the moving\\nred and white lights along the drive and the lights of the bridges\\nwhose names I didn\\'t know.\\n\\nThe silence depressed me.  It wasn\\'t the silence of silence.  It was my\\nown silence.\\n\\nI knew perfectly well the cars were making a noise, and the people in\\nthem and behind the lit windows of the buildings were making a noise,\\nand the river was making a noise, but I couldn\\'t hear a thing.  The\\ncity hung in my window, flat as a poster, glittering and blinking, but\\nit might just as well not have been there at all, for all the good it\\ndid me.\\n\\nThe china-white bedside telephone could have connected me up with\\nthings, but there it sat, dumb as a death\\'s head.  I tried to think of\\npeople I\\'d given my phone number to, so I could make a list of all the\\npossible calls I might be about to receive, but all I could think of\\nwas that I\\'d given my phone number to Buddy Willard\\'s mother so she\\ncould give it to a simultaneous interpreter she knew at the UN.\\n\\nI let out a small, dry laugh.\\n\\nI could imagine the sort of simultaneous interpreter Mrs Willard would\\nintroduce me to when all the time she wanted me to marry Buddy, who was\\ntaking the cure for TB somewhere in upper New York State.  Buddy\\'s\\nmother had even arranged for me to be given a job as a waitress at the\\nTB sanatorium that summer so Buddy wouldn\\'t be lonely.  She and Buddy\\ncouldn\\'t understand why I chose to go to New York City instead.\\n\\nThe mirror over my bureau seemed slightly warped and much too silver.\\nThe face in it looked like the reflection in a ball of dentist\\'s\\nmercury.  I thought of crawling in between the bed-sheets and trying to\\nsleep, but that appealed to me about as much as stuffing a dirty,\\nscrawled-over letter into a fresh, clean envelope.  I decided to take a\\nhot bath.\\n\\nThere must be quite a few things a hot bath won\\'t cure, but I don\\'t\\nknow many of them.  Whenever I\\'m sad I\\'m going to die, or so nervous I\\ncan\\'t sleep, or in love with somebody I won\\'t be seeing for a week, I\\nslump down just so far and then I say: \\'I\\'ll go take a hot bath.\\'\\n\\nI meditate in the bath.  The water needs to be very hot, so hot you can\\nbarely stand putting your foot in it.  Then you lower yourself, inch by\\ninch, till the water\\'s up to your neck.\\n\\nI remember the ceilings over every bathtub I\\'ve stretched out in.  I\\nremember the texture of the ceilings and the cracks and the colours and\\nthe damp spots and the light fixtures.  I remember the tubs, too: the\\nantique griffin-legged tubs, and the modern coffin-shaped tubs, and the\\nfancy pink marble tubs overlooking indoor lily ponds, and I remember\\nthe shapes and sizes of the water taps and the different sorts of\\nsoap-holders.\\n\\nI never feel so much myself as when I\\'m in a hot bath.\\n\\nI lay in that tub on the seventeenth floor of this hotel\\nfor-women-only, high up over the jazz and push of New York, for near on\\nto an hour, and I felt myself growing pure again.  I don\\'t believe in\\nbaptism or the waters of Jordan or anything like that, but I guess I\\nfeel about a hot bath the way those religious people feel about holy\\nwater.\\n\\nI said to myself: \\'Doreen is dissolving, Lenny Shepherd is dissolving,\\nFrankie is dissolving, New York is dissolving, they are all dissolving\\naway and none of them matter any more.  I don\\'t know them, I have never\\nknown them and I am very pure.  All that liquor and those sticky kisses\\nI saw and the dirt that settled on my skin on the way back is turning\\ninto something pure.\\'\\n\\nThe longer I lay there in the clear hot water the purer I felt, and\\nwhen I stepped out at last and wrapped myself in one of the big, soft,\\nwhite, hotel bath-towels I felt pure and sweet as a new baby.\\n\\n\\nI don\\'t know how long I had been asleep when I heard the knocking.  I\\ndidn\\'t pay any attention at first, because the person knocking kept\\nsaying \\'Elly, Elly, Elly, let me in\\', and I didn\\'t know any Elly.  Then\\nanother kind of knock sounded over the first dull, bumping knock--a\\nsharp tap-tap, and another, much crisper voice said \\'Miss Greenwood,\\nyour friend wants you,\\' and I knew it was Doreen.\\n\\nI swung to my feet and balanced dizzily for a minute in the middle of\\nthe dark room.  I felt angry with Doreen for waking me up.  All I stood\\na chance of getting out of that sad night was a good sleep, and she had\\nto wake me up and spoil it.  I thought if I pretended to be asleep the\\nknocking might go away and leave me in peace, but I waited, and it\\ndidn\\'t.\\n\\n\\'Elly, Elly, Elly,\\' the first voice mumbled, while the other voice went\\non hissing \\'Miss Greenwood, Miss Greenwood, Miss Greenwood\\', as if I\\nhad a split personality or something.\\n\\nI opened the door and blinked out into the bright hall.  I had the\\nimpression it wasn\\'t night and it wasn\\'t day, but some lurid third\\ninterval that had suddenly slipped between them and would never end.\\n\\nDoreen was slumped against the door-jamb.  When I came out, she toppled\\ninto my arms.  I couldn\\'t see her face because her head was hanging\\ndown on her chest and her stiff blonde hair fell from its dark roots\\nlike a hula fringe.\\n\\nI recognized the short, squat, moustached woman in the black uniform as\\nthe night maid who ironed day-dresses and party-frocks in a crowded\\ncubicle on our floor.  I couldn\\'t understand how she came to know\\nDoreen or why she should want to help Doreen wake me up instead of\\nleading her quietly back to her own room.\\n\\nSeeing Doreen supported in my arms and silent except for a few wet\\nhiccups, the woman strode away down the hall to her cubicle with its\\nancient Singer sewing-machine and white ironing-board.  I wanted to run\\nafter her and tell her I had nothing to do with Doreen, because she\\nlooked stern and hard-working and moral as an old-style European\\nimmigrant and reminded me of my Austrian grandmother.\\n\\n\\'Lemme lie down, lemme lie down,\\' Doreen was muttering.  \\'Lemme lie\\ndown, lemme lie down.\\'\\n\\nI felt if I carried Doreen across the threshold into my room and helped\\nher on to my bed I would never get rid of her again.\\n\\nHer body was warm and soft as a pile of pillows against my arm where\\nshe leaned her weight, and her feet, in their high, spiked heels,\\ndragged foolishly.  She was much too heavy for me to budge down the\\nlong hall.\\n\\nI decided the only thing to do was to dump her on the carpet and shut\\nand lock my door and go back to bed.  When Doreen woke up she wouldn\\'t\\nremember what had happened and would think she must have passed out in\\nfront of my door while I slept, and she would get up of her own accord\\nand go sensibly back to her room.\\n\\nI started to lower Doreen gently on to the green hall carpet, but she\\ngave a low moan and pitched forward out of my arms.  A jet of brown\\nvomit flew from her mouth and spread in a large puddle at my feet.\\n\\nSuddenly Doreen grew even heavier.  Her head drooped forward into the\\npuddle, the wisps of her blonde hair dabbling in it like tree roots in\\na bog, and I realized she was asleep.  I drew back.  I felt half-asleep\\nmyself.\\n\\nI made a decision about Doreen that night.  I decided I would watch her\\nand listen to what she said, but deep down I would have nothing at all\\nto do with her.  Deep down, I would be loyal to Betsy and her innocent\\nfriends.  It was Betsy I resembled at heart.\\n\\nQuietly, I stepped back into my room and shut the door.  On second\\nthoughts, I didn\\'t lock it.  I couldn\\'t quite bring myself to do that.\\n\\nWhen I woke up in the dull, sunless heat the next morning, I dressed\\nand splashed my face with cold water and put on some lipstick and\\nopened the door slowly.  I think I still expected to see Doreen\\'s body\\nlying there in the pool of vomit like an ugly, concrete testimony to my\\nown dirty nature.\\n\\nThere was nobody in the hall.  The carpet stretched from one end of the\\nhall to the other, clean and eternally verdant except for a faint,\\nirregular dark stain before my door as if somebody had by accident\\nspilled a glass of water there, but dabbed it dry again.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter Three\\n\\nArrayed on the _Ladies\\' Day_ banquet table were yellow-green avocado\\npear halves stuffed with crabmeat and mayonnaise, and platters of rare\\nroast beef and cold chicken, and every so often a cut-glass bowl heaped\\nwith black caviar.  I hadn\\'t had time to eat any breakfast at the hotel\\ncafeteria that morning, except for a cup of over-stewed coffee so\\nbitter it made my nose curl, and I was starving.\\n\\nBefore I came to New York I\\'d never eaten out in a proper restaurant.\\nI don\\'t count Howard Johnson\\'s, where I only had French fries and\\ncheeseburgers and vanilla frappes with people like Buddy Willard.  I\\'m\\nnot sure why it is, but I love food more than just about anything else.\\nNo matter how much I eat, I never put on weight.  With one exception\\nI\\'ve been the same weight for ten years.\\n\\nMy favourite dishes are full of butter and cheese and sour cream.  In\\nNew York we had so many free luncheons with people on the magazine and\\nvarious visiting celebrities I developed the habit of running my eye\\ndown those huge, handwritten menus, where a tiny side-dish of peas\\ncosts fifty or sixty cents, until I\\'d picked the richest, most\\nexpensive dishes and ordered a string of them.\\n\\nWe were always taken out on expense accounts, so I never felt guilty.\\nI made a point of eating so fast I never kept the other people waiting\\nwho generally ordered only chef\\'s salad and grapefruit juice because\\nthey were trying to reduce.  Almost everybody I met in New York was\\ntrying to reduce.\\n\\n\\'I want to welcome the prettiest, smartest bunch of young ladies our\\nstaff has yet had the good luck to meet,\\' the plump, bald\\nmaster-of-ceremonies wheezed into his lapel microphone.  \\'This banquet\\nis just a small sample of the hospitality our Food Testing Kitchens\\nhere on _Ladies\\' Day_ would like to offer in appreciation for your\\nvisit.\\'\\n\\nA delicate, ladylike spatter of applause, and we all sat down at the\\nenormous linen-draped table.\\n\\nThere were eleven of us girls from the magazine, together with most of\\nour supervising editors, and the whole staff of the _Ladies\\' Day_ Food\\nTesting Kitchens in hygienic white smocks, neat hair-nets and flawless\\nmake-up of a uniform peach-pie colour.\\n\\nThere were only eleven of us, because Doreen was missing.  They had set\\nher place next to mine for some reason, and the chair stayed empty.  I\\nsaved her place-card for her--a pocket mirror with \\'Doreen\\' painted\\nalong the top of it in lacy script and a wreath of frosted daisies\\naround the edge, framing the silver hole where her face would show.\\n\\nDoreen was spending the day with Lenny Shepherd.  She spent most of her\\nfree time with Lenny Shepherd now.\\n\\nIn the hour before our luncheon at _Ladies\\' Day_--the big women\\'s\\nmagazine that features lush double-page spreads of technicolour meals,\\nwith a different theme and locale each month--we had been shown around\\nthe endless glossy kitchens and seen how difficult it is to photograph\\napple pie _à la mode_ under bright lights because the ice-cream keeps\\nmelting and has to be propped up from behind with toothpicks and\\nchanged every time it starts looking too soppy.\\n\\nThe sight of all the food stacked in those kitchens made me dizzy.\\nIt\\'s not that we hadn\\'t enough to eat at home, it\\'s just that my\\ngrandmother always cooked economy joints and economy meat-loafs and had\\nthe habit of saying, the minute you lifted the first forkful to your\\nmouth, \\'I hope you enjoy that, it cost forty-one cents a pound,\\' which\\nalways made me feel I was somehow eating pennies instead of Sunday\\nroast.\\n\\nWhile we were standing up behind our chairs listening to the welcome\\nspeech, I had bowed my head and secretly eyed the position of the bowls\\nof caviar.  One bowl was set strategically between me and Doreen\\'s\\nempty chair.\\n\\nI figured the girl across from me couldn\\'t reach it because of the\\nmountainous centrepiece of marzipan fruit, and Betsy, on my right,\\nwould be too nice to ask me to share it with her if I just kept it out\\nof the way at my elbow by my bread-and-butter plate.  Besides, another\\nbowl of caviar sat a little way to the right of the girl next to Betsy,\\nand she could eat that.\\n\\nMy grandfather and I had a standing joke.  He was the head waiter at a\\ncountry club near my home town, and every Sunday my grandmother drove\\nin to bring him home for his Monday off.  My brother and I alternated\\ngoing with her, and my grandfather always served Sunday supper to my\\ngrandmother and whichever of us was along as if we were regular club\\nguests.  He loved introducing me to special titbits, and by the age of\\nnine I had developed a passionate taste for cold vichyssoise and caviar\\nand anchovy paste.\\n\\nThe joke was that at my wedding my grandfather would see I had all the\\ncaviar I could eat.  It was a joke because I never intended to get\\nmarried, and even if I did, my grandfather couldn\\'t have afforded\\nenough caviar unless he robbed the country club kitchen and carried it\\noff in a suitcase.\\n\\nUnder cover of the clinking of water goblets and silverware and bone\\nchina, I paved my plate with chicken slices.  Then I covered the\\nchicken slices with caviar thickly as if I were spreading peanut-butter\\non a piece of bread.  Then I picked up the chicken slices in my fingers\\none by one, rolled them so the caviar wouldn\\'t ooze off and ate them.\\n\\nI\\'d discovered, after a lot of extreme apprehension about what spoons\\nto use, that if you do something incorrect at table with a certain\\narrogance, as if you knew perfectly well you were doing it properly,\\nyou can get away with it and nobody will think you are bad-mannered or\\npoorly brought up.  They will think you are original and very witty.\\n\\nI learned this trick the day Jay Cee took me to lunch with a famous\\npoet.  He wore a horrible, lumpy, speckled brown tweed jacket and grey\\npants and a red-and-blue checked open-throated jersey in a very formal\\nrestaurant full of fountains and chandeliers, where all the other men\\nwere dressed in dark suits and immaculate white shirts.\\n\\nThis poet ate his salad with his fingers, leaf by leaf, while talking\\nto me about the antithesis of nature and art.  I couldn\\'t take my eyes\\noff the pale, stubby white fingers travelling back and forth from the\\npoet\\'s salad bowl to the poet\\'s mouth with one dripping lettuce leaf\\nafter another.  Nobody giggled or whispered rude remarks.  The poet\\nmade eating salad with your fingers seem to be the only natural and\\nsensible thing to do.\\n\\nNone of our magazine editors or the _Ladies\\' Day_ staff members sat\\nanywhere near me, and Betsy seemed sweet and friendly, she didn\\'t even\\nseem to like caviar, so I grew more and more confident.  When I\\nfinished my first plate of cold chicken and caviar, I laid out another.\\nThen I tackled the avocado and crabmeat salad.\\n\\nAvocados are my favourite fruit.  Every Sunday my grandfather used to\\nbring me an avocado pear hidden at the bottom of his briefcase under\\nsix soiled shirts and the Sunday comics.  He taught me how to eat\\navocados by melting grape jelly and French dressing together in a\\nsaucepan and filling the cup of the pear with the garnet sauce.  I felt\\nhomesick for that sauce.  The crabmeat tasted bland in comparison.\\n\\n\\'How was the fur show?\\' I asked Betsy, when I was no longer worried\\nabout competition over my caviar.  I scraped the last few salty black\\neggs from the dish with my soup spoon and licked it clean.\\n\\n\\'It was wonderful,\\' Betsy smiled.  \\'They showed us how to make an\\nall-purpose neckerchief out of mink tails and a gold chain, the sort of\\nchain you can get an exact copy of at Woolworth\\'s for a dollar\\nninety-eight, and Hilda nipped down to the wholesale fur warehouses\\nright afterwards and bought a bunch of mink tails at a big discount and\\ndropped in at Woolworth\\'s and then stitched the whole thing together\\ncoming up on the bus.\\'\\n\\nI peered over at Hilda, who sat on the other side of Betsy.  Sure\\nenough, she was wearing an expensive-looking scarf of furry tails\\nfastened on one side by a dangling gilt chain.\\n\\nI never really understood Hilda.  She was six feet tall, with huge,\\nslanted, green eyes and thick red lips and a vacant, Slavic expression.\\nShe made hats.  She was apprenticed to the Fashion Editor, which set\\nher apart from the more literary ones among us like Doreen and Betsy\\nand I myself, who all wrote columns, even if some of them were only\\nabout health and beauty.  I don\\'t know if Hilda could read, but she\\nmade startling hats.  She went to a special school for making hats in\\nNew York and every day she wore a new hat to work, constructed by her\\nown hands out of bits of straw or fur or ribbon or veiling in subtle,\\nbizarre shades.\\n\\n\\'That\\'s amazing,\\' I said.  \\'Amazing.\\'  I missed Doreen.  She would have\\nmurmured some fine, scalding remark about Hilda\\'s miraculous furpiece\\nto cheer me up.\\n\\nI felt very low.  I had been unmasked only that morning by Jay Cee\\nherself, and I felt now that all the uncomfortable suspicions I had\\nabout myself were coming true, and I couldn\\'t hide the truth much\\nlonger.  After nineteen years of running after good marks and prizes\\nand grants of one sort and another, I was letting up, slowing down,\\ndropping clean out of the race.\\n\\n\\'Why didn\\'t you come along to the fur show with us?\\' Betsy asked.  I\\nhad the impression she was repeating herself, and that she\\'d asked me\\nthe same question a minute ago, only I couldn\\'t have been listening.\\n\\'Did you go off with Doreen?\\'\\n\\n\\'No,\\' I said, \\'I wanted to go to the fur show, but Jay Cee called up\\nand made me come into the office.\\'  That wasn\\'t quite true about\\nwanting to go to the show, but I tried to convince myself now that it\\nwas true, so I could be really wounded about what Jay Cee had done.\\n\\nI told Betsy how I had been lying in bed that morning planning to go to\\nthe fur show.  What I didn\\'t tell her was that Doreen had come into my\\nroom earlier and said, \\'What do you want to go to that assy show for,\\nLenny and I are going to Coney Island, so why don\\'t you come along?\\nLenny can get you a nice fellow, the day\\'s shot to hell anyhow with\\nthat luncheon and then the film première in the afternoon, so nobody\\'ll\\nmiss us.\\'\\n\\nFor a minute I was tempted.  The show certainly did seem stupid.  I\\nhave never cared for furs.  What I decided to do in the end was to lie\\nin bed as long as I wanted to and then go to Central Park and spend the\\nday lying in the grass, the longest grass I could find in that bald,\\nduck-ponded wilderness.\\n\\nI told Doreen I would not go to the show or the luncheon or the film\\npremière, but that I would not go to Coney Island either, I would stay\\nin bed.  After Doreen left, I wondered why I couldn\\'t go the whole way\\ndoing what I should any more.  This made me sad and tired.  Then I\\nwondered why I couldn\\'t go the whole way doing what I shouldn\\'t, the\\nway Doreen did, and this made me even sadder and more tired.\\n\\nI didn\\'t know what time it was, but I\\'d heard the girls bustling and\\ncalling in the hall and getting ready for the fur show, and then I\\'d\\nheard the hall go still, and as I lay on my back in bed staring up at\\nthe blank, white ceiling the stillness seemed to grow bigger and bigger\\nuntil I felt my eardrums would burst with it.  Then the phone rang.\\n\\nI stared at the phone for a minute.  The receiver shook a bit in its\\nbone-coloured cradle, so I could tell it was really ringing.  I thought\\nI might have given my phone number to somebody at a dance or a party\\nand then forgotten clean, about it.  I lifted the receiver and spoke in\\na husky, receptive voice.\\n\\n\\'Hello?\\'\\n\\n\\'Jay Cee here,\\' Jay Cee rapped out with brutal promptitude.  \\'I\\nwondered if you happened to be planning to come into the office today?\\'\\n\\nI sank down into the sheets.  I couldn\\'t understand why Jay Cee thought\\nI\\'d be coming into the office.  We had these mimeographed schedule\\ncards so we could keep track of all our activities, and we spent a lot\\nof mornings and afternoons away from the office going to affairs in\\ntown.  Of course, some of the affairs were optional.\\n\\nThere was quite a pause.  Then I said meekly, \\'I thought I was going to\\nthe fur show.\\'  Of course I hadn\\'t thought any such thing, but I\\ncouldn\\'t figure out what else to say.\\n\\n\\'I told her I thought I was going to the fur show,\\' I said to Betsy.\\n\\'But she told me to come into the office, she wanted to have a little\\ntalk with me, and there was some work to do.\\'\\n\\n\\'Oh-oh!\\' Betsy said sympathetically.  She must have seen the tears that\\nplopped down into my dessert dish of meringue and brandy ice-cream,\\nbecause she pushed over her own untouched dessert and I started\\nabsently on that when I\\'d finished my own.  I felt a bit awkward about\\nthe tears, but they were real enough.  Jay Cee had said some terrible\\nthings to me.\\n\\n\\nWhen I made my wan entrance into the office at about ten o\\'clock, Jay\\nCee stood up and came round her desk to shut the door, and I sat in the\\nswivel chair in front of my typewriter table facing her, and she sat in\\nthe swivel chair behind her desk facing me, with the window full of\\npotted plants, shelf after shelf of them, springing up at her back like\\na tropical garden.\\n\\n\\'Doesn\\'t your work interest you, Esther?\\'\\n\\n\\'Oh, it does, it does,\\' I said.  \\'It interests me very much.\\'  I felt\\nlike yelling the words, as if that might make them more convincing, but\\nI controlled myself.\\n\\nAll my life I\\'d told myself studying and reading and writing and\\nworking like mad was what I wanted to do, and it actually seemed to be\\ntrue, I did everything well enough and got all A\\'s, and by the time I\\nmade it to college nobody could stop me.\\n\\nI was college correspondent for the town _Gazette_ and editor of the\\nliterary magazine and secretary of Honour Board, which deals with\\nacademic and social offences and punishments--a popular office, and I\\nhad a well-known woman poet and professor on the faculty championing me\\nfor graduate school at the biggest universities in the east, and\\npromises of full scholarships all the way, and now I was apprenticed to\\nthe best editor on any intellectual fashion magazine, and what did I do\\nbut balk and balk like a dull cart horse?\\n\\n\\'I\\'m very interested in everything.\\'  The words fell with a hollow\\nflatness on to Jay Cee\\'s desk, like so many wooden nickels.\\n\\n\\'I\\'m glad of that,\\' Jay Cee said a bit waspishly.  \\'You can learn a lot\\nin this month on the magazine, you know, if you just roll up your\\nshirt-cuffs.  The girl who was here before you didn\\'t bother with any\\nof the fashion show stuff.  She went straight from this office, on to\\n_Time_.\\'\\n\\n\\'My!\\' I said, in the same sepulchral tone.  \\'That was quick!\\'\\n\\n\\'Of course, you have another year at college yet,\\' Jay Cee went on a\\nlittle more mildly.  \\'What do you have in mind after you graduate?\\'\\n\\nWhat I always thought I had in mind was getting some big scholarship to\\ngraduate school or a grant to study all over Europe, and then I thought\\nI\\'d be a professor and write books of poems or write books of poems and\\nbe an editor of some sort.  Usually I had these plans on the tip of my\\ntongue.\\n\\n\\'I don\\'t really know,\\' I heard myself say.  I felt a deep shock,\\nhearing myself say that, because the minute I said it, I knew it was\\ntrue.\\n\\nIt sounded true, and I recognized it, the way you recognize some\\nnondescript person that\\'s been hanging around your door for ages and\\nthen suddenly comes up and introduces himself as your real father and\\nlooks exactly like you, so you know he really is your father, and the\\nperson you thought all your life was your father is a sham.\\n\\n\\'I don\\'t really know.\\'\\n\\n\\'You\\'ll never get anywhere like that.\\'  Jay Cee paused.  \\'What\\nlanguages do you have?\\'\\n\\n\\'Oh, I can read a bit of French, I guess, and I\\'ve always wanted to\\nlearn German.\\'  I\\'d been telling people I\\'d always wanted to learn\\nGerman for about five years.\\n\\nMy mother spoke German during her childhood in America and was stoned\\nfor it during the First World War by the children at school.  My\\nGerman-speaking father, dead since I was nine, came from some\\nmanic-depressive hamlet in the black heart of Prussia.  My younger\\nbrother was at that moment on the Experiment in International Living in\\nBerlin and speaking German like a native.\\n\\nWhat I didn\\'t say was that each time I picked up a German dictionary or\\na German book, the very sight of those dense, black, barbed-wire\\nletters made my mind shut like a clam.\\n\\n\\'I\\'ve always thought I\\'d like to go into publishing.\\'  I tried to\\nrecover a thread that might lead me back to my old, bright\\nsalesmanship.  \\'I guess what I\\'ll do is apply at some publishing house.\\'\\n\\n\\'You ought to read French and German,\\' Jay Cee said mercilessly, \\'and\\nprobably several other languages as well, Spanish and Italian--better\\nstill, Russian.  Hundreds of girls flood into New York every June\\nthinking they\\'ll be editors.  You need to offer something more than the\\nrun-of-the-mill person.  You better learn some languages.\\'\\n\\nI hadn\\'t the heart to tell Jay Cee there wasn\\'t one scrap of space on\\nmy senior year schedule to learn languages in.  I was taking one of\\nthose honours programmes that teaches you to think independently, and\\nexcept for a course in Tolstoy and Dostoevsky and a seminar in advanced\\npoetry-composition, I would spend my whole time writing on some obscure\\ntheme in the works of James Joyce.  I hadn\\'t picked out my theme yet,\\nbecause I hadn\\'t got round to reading _Finnegan\\'s Wake_, but my\\nprofessor was very excited about my thesis and had promised to give me\\nsome leads on images about twins.\\n\\n\\'I\\'ll see what I can do,\\' I told Jay Cee.  \\'I probably might just fit\\nin one of those double-barrelled, accelerated courses in elementary\\nGerman they\\'ve rigged up.\\'  I thought at the time I might actually do\\nthis.  I had a way of persuading my Class Dean to let me do irregular\\nthings.  She regarded me as a sort of interesting experiment.\\n\\nAt college I had to take a required course in physics and chemistry.  I\\nhad already taken a course in botany and done very well.  I never\\nanswered one test question wrong the whole year, and for a while I\\ntoyed with the idea of being a botanist and studying the wild grasses\\nin Africa or the South American rain forests, because you can win big\\ngrants to study off-beat things like that in queer areas much more\\neasily than winning grants to study art in Italy or English in England,\\nthere\\'s not so much competition.\\n\\nBotany was fine, because I loved cutting up leaves and putting them\\nunder the microscope and drawing diagrams of bread mould and the odd,\\nheart-shaped leaf in the sex cycle of the fern, it seemed so real to me.\\n\\nThe day I went into physics class it was death.\\n\\nA short dark man with a high, lisping voice, named Mr Manzi, stood in\\nfront of the class in a tight blue suit holding a little wooden ball.\\nHe put the ball on a steep grooved slide and let it run down to the\\nbottom.  Then he started talking about let _a_ equal acceleration and\\nlet _t_ equal time and suddenly he was scribbling letters and numbers\\nand equals signs all over the blackboard and my mind went dead.\\n\\nI took the physics book back to my dormitory.  It was a huge book on\\nporous mimeographed paper--four hundred pages long with no drawings or\\nphotographs, only diagrams and formulas--between brick-red cardboard\\ncovers.  This book was written by Mr Manzi to explain physics to\\ncollege girls, and if it worked on us he would try to have it published.\\n\\nWell, I studied those formulas, I went to class and watched balls roll\\ndown slides and listened to bells ring and by the end of the semester\\nmost of the other girls had failed and I had a straight A.  I heard Mr\\nManzi saying to a bunch of the girls who were complaining that the\\ncourse was too hard, \\'No, it can\\'t be too hard, because one girl got a\\nstraight A.\\'  \\'Who is it?  Tell us,\\' they said, but he shook his head\\nand didn\\'t say anything and gave me a sweet little conspiring smile.\\n\\nThat\\'s what gave me the idea of escaping the next semester of\\nchemistry.  I may have made a straight A in physics, but I was\\npanic-struck.  Physics made me sick the whole time I learned it.  What\\nI couldn\\'t stand was this shrinking everything into letters and\\nnumbers.  Instead of leaf shapes and enlarged diagrams of the holes the\\nleaves breathe through and fascinating words like carotene and\\nxanthophyll on the blackboard, there were these hideous, cramped,\\nscorpion-lettered formulas in Mr Manzi\\'s special red chalk.\\n\\nI knew chemistry would be worse, because I\\'d seen a big chart of the\\nninety-odd elements hung up in the chemistry lab, and all the perfectly\\ngood words like gold and silver and cobalt and aluminium were shortened\\nto ugly abbreviations with different decimal numbers after them.  If I\\nhad to strain my brain with any more of that stuff I would go mad.  I\\nwould fail outright.  It was only by a horrible effort of will that I\\nhad dragged myself through the first half of the year.\\n\\nSo I went to my Class Dean with a clever plan.\\n\\nMy plan was that I needed the time to take a course in Shakespeare,\\nsince I was, after all, an English major.  She knew and I knew\\nperfectly well I would get a straight A again in the chemistry course,\\nso what was the point of my taking the exams, why couldn\\'t I just go to\\nthe classes and look on and take it all in and forget about marks or\\ncredits?  It was a case of honour among honourable people, and the\\ncontent meant more than the form, and marks were really a bit silly\\nanyway, weren\\'t they, when you knew you\\'d always get an A?  My plan was\\nstrengthened by the fact that the college had just dropped the second\\nyear of required science for the classes after me anyway, so my class\\nwas the last to suffer under the old ruling.\\n\\nMr Manzi was in perfect agreement with my plan.  I think it flattered\\nhim that I enjoyed his classes so much I would take them for no\\nmaterialistic reason like credit and an A, but for the sheer beauty of\\nchemistry itself.  I thought it was quite ingenious of me to suggest\\nsitting in on the chemistry course even after I\\'d changed over to\\nShakespeare.  It was quite an unnecessary gesture and made it seem I\\nsimply couldn\\'t bear to give chemistry up.\\n\\nOf course, I would never have succeeded with this scheme if I hadn\\'t\\nmade that A in the first place.  And if my Class Dean had known how\\nscared and depressed I was, and how I seriously contemplated desperate\\nremedies such as getting a doctor\\'s certificate that I was unfit to\\nstudy chemistry, the formulas made me dizzy and so on, I\\'m sure she\\nwouldn\\'t have listened to me for a minute, but would have made me take\\nthe course regardless.\\n\\nAs it happened, the Faculty Board passed my petition, and my Class Dean\\ntold me later that several of the professors were touched by it.  They\\ntook it as a real step in intellectual maturity.\\n\\nI had to laugh when I thought about the rest of that year.  I went to\\nthe chemistry class five times a week and didn\\'t miss a single one.  Mr\\nManzi stood at the bottom of the big, rickety old amphitheatre, making\\nblue flames and red flares and clouds of yellow stuff by pouring the\\ncontents of one test-tube into another, and I shut his voice out of my\\nears by pretending it was only a mosquito in the distance and sat back\\nenjoying the bright lights and the coloured fires and wrote page after\\npage of villanelles and sonnets.\\n\\nMr Manzi would glance at me now and then and see me writing, and send\\nup a sweet little appreciative smile.  I guess he thought I was writing\\ndown all those formulas not for exam time, like the other girls, but\\nbecause his presentation fascinated me so much I couldn\\'t help it.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter Four\\n\\nI don\\'t know just why my successful evasion of chemistry should have\\nfloated into my mind there in Jay Cee\\'s office.\\n\\nAll the time she talked to me, I saw Mr Manzi standing on thin air in\\nback of Jay Cee\\'s head, like something conjured up out of a hat,\\nholding his little wooden ball and the test-tube that billowed a great\\ncloud of yellow smoke the day before Easter vacation and smelt of\\nrotten eggs and made all the girls and Mr Manzi laugh.\\n\\nI felt sorry for Mr Manzi.  I felt like going down to him on my hands\\nand knees and apologizing for being such an awful liar.\\n\\nJay Cee handed me a pile of story manuscripts and spoke to me much more\\nkindly.  I spent the rest of the morning reading the stories and typing\\nout what I thought of them on the pink Interoffice Memo sheets and\\nsending them into the office of Betsy\\'s editor to be read by Betsy the\\nnext day.  Jay Cee interrupted me now and then to tell me something\\npractical or a bit of gossip.\\n\\nJay Cee was going to lunch that noon with two famous writers, a man and\\na lady.  The man had just sold six short stories to the _New Yorker_\\nand six to Jay Cee.  This surprised me, as I didn\\'t know magazines\\nbought stories in lots of six, and I was staggered by the thought of\\nthe amount of money six stories would probably bring in.  Jay Cee said\\nshe had to be very careful at this lunch, because the lady writer wrote\\nstories too, but she had never had any in the _New Yorker_ and Jay Cee\\nhad only taken one from her in five years.  Jay Cee had to flatter the\\nmore famous man at the same time as she was careful not to hurt the\\nless famous lady.\\n\\nWhen the cherubs in Jay Cee\\'s French wall-clock waved their wings up\\nand down and put their little gilt trumpets to their lips and pinged\\nout twelve notes one after the other, Jay Cee told me I\\'d done enough\\nwork for the day, and to go off to the _Ladies\\' Day_ tour and banquet\\nand to the film première, and she would see me bright and early\\ntomorrow.\\n\\nThen she slipped a suit jacket over her lilac blouse, pinned a hat of\\nimitation lilacs on the top of her head, powdered her nose briefly and\\nadjusted her thick spectacles.  She looked terrible, but very wise.  As\\nshe left the office, she patted my shoulder with one lilac-gloved hand.\\n\\n\\'Don\\'t let the wicked city get you down.\\'\\n\\nI sat quietly in my swivel chair for a few minutes and thought about\\nJay Cee.  I tried to imagine what it would be like if I were Ee Gee,\\nthe famous editor, in an office full of potted rubber plants and\\nAfrican violets my secretary had to water each morning.  I wished I had\\na mother like Jay Cee.  Then I\\'d know what to do.\\n\\nMy own mother wasn\\'t much help.  My mother had taught shorthand and\\ntyping to support us ever since my father died, and secretly she hated\\nit and hated him for dying and leaving no money because he didn\\'t trust\\nlife insurance salesmen.  She was always on to me to learn shorthand\\nafter college, so I\\'d have a practical skill as well as a college\\ndegree.  \\'Even the apostles were tent-makers,\\' she\\'d say.  \\'They had to\\nlive, just the way we do.\\'\\n\\n\\nI dabbled my fingers in the bowl of warm water a _Ladies\\' Day_ waitress\\nset down in place of my two empty ice-cream dishes.  Then I wiped each\\nfinger carefully with my linen napkin which was still quite clean.\\nThen I folded the linen napkin and laid it between my lips and brought\\nmy lips down on it precisely.  When I put the napkin back on the table\\na fuzzy pink lip-shape bloomed right in the middle of it like a tiny\\nheart.\\n\\nI thought what a long way I had come.\\n\\nThe first time I saw a finger-bowl was at the home of my benefactress.\\nIt was the custom at my college, the little freckled lady in the\\nScholarships Office told me, to write to the person whose scholarship\\nyou had, if they were still alive, and thank them for it.\\n\\nI had the scholarship of Philomena Guinea, a wealthy novelist who went\\nto my college in the early nineteen-hundreds and had her first novel\\nmade into a silent film with Bette Davis as well as a radio serial that\\nwas still running, and it turned out she was alive and lived in a large\\nmansion not far from my grandfather\\'s country club.\\n\\nSo I wrote Philomena Guinea a long letter in coal-black ink on grey\\npaper with the name of the college embossed on it in red.  I wrote what\\nthe leaves looked like in autumn when I bicycled out into the hills,\\nand how wonderful it was to live on a campus instead of commuting by\\nbus to a city college and having to live at home, and how all knowledge\\nwas opening up before me and perhaps one day I would be able to write\\ngreat books the way she did.\\n\\nI had read one of Mrs Guinea\\'s books in the town library--the college\\nlibrary didn\\'t stock them for some reason--and it was crammed from\\nbeginning to end with long, suspenseful questions: \\'Would Evelyn\\ndiscern that Gladys knew Roger in her past? wondered Hector feverishly\\'\\nand \\'How could Donald marry her when he learned of the child Elsie,\\nhidden away with Mrs Rollmop on the secluded country farm? Griselda\\ndemanded of her bleak, moonlit pillow.\\'  These books earned Philomena\\nGuinea, who later told me she had been very stupid at college, millions\\nand millions of dollars.\\n\\nMrs Guinea answered my letter and invited me to lunch at her home.\\nThat was where I saw my first finger-bowl.\\n\\nThe water had a few cherry blossoms floating in it, and I thought it\\nmust be some clear sort of Japanese after-dinner soup and ate every bit\\nof it, including the crisp little blossoms.  Mrs Guinea never said\\nanything, and it was only much later, when I told a debutante I knew at\\ncollege about the dinner, that I learned what I had done.\\n\\n\\nWhen we came out of the sunnily-lit interior of the _Ladies\\' Day_\\noffices, the streets were grey and fuming with rain.  It wasn\\'t the\\nnice kind of rain that rinses you clean, but the sort of rain I imagine\\nthey must have in Brazil.  It flew straight down from the sky in drops\\nthe size of coffee saucers and hit the hot sidewalks with a hiss that\\nsent clouds of stream writhing up from the gleaming, dark concrete.\\n\\nMy secret hope of spending the afternoon alone in Central Park died in\\nthe glass egg-beater of _Ladies\\' Day\\'s_ revolving doors.  I found\\nmyself spewed out through the warm rain and into the dim, throbbing\\ncave of a cab, together with Betsy and Hilda and Emily Ann Offenbach, a\\nprim little girl with a bun of red hair and a husband and three\\nchildren in Teaneck, New Jersey.\\n\\nThe movie was very poor.  It starred a nice blonde girl who looked like\\nJune Allyson but was really somebody else, and a sexy black-haired girl\\nwho looked like Elizabeth Taylor but was also somebody else, and two\\nbig, broad-shouldered boneheads with names like Rick and Gil.\\n\\nIt was a football romance and it was in technicolour.\\n\\nI hate technicolour.  Everybody in a technicolour movie seems to feel\\nobliged to wear a lurid new costume in each new scene and to stand\\naround like a clothes-horse with a lot of very green trees or very\\nyellow wheat or very blue ocean rolling away for miles and miles in\\nevery direction.\\n\\nMost of the action in this picture took place in the football stands,\\nwith the two girls waving and cheering in smart suits with orange\\nchrysanthemums the size of cabbages on their lapels, or in a ballroom,\\nwhere the girls swooped across the floor with their dates, in dresses\\nlike something out of _Gone With the Wind_, and then sneaked off into\\nthe powder-room to say nasty intense things to each other.\\n\\nFinally I could see the nice girl was going to end up with the nice\\nfootball hero and the sexy girl was going to end up with nobody,\\nbecause the man named Gil had only wanted a mistress and not a wife all\\nalong and was now packing off to Europe on a single ticket.\\n\\nAt about this point I began to feel peculiar.  I looked round me at all\\nthe rows of rapt little heads with the same silver glow on them at the\\nfront and the same black shadow on them at the back, and they looked\\nlike nothing more or less than a lot of stupid moon-brains.\\n\\nI felt in terrible danger of puking.  I didn\\'t know whether it was the\\nawful movie giving me a stomach-ache or all that caviar I had eaten.\\n\\n\\'I\\'m going back to the hotel,\\' I whispered to Betsy through the\\nhalf-dark.\\n\\nBetsy was staring at the screen with deadly concentration.  \\'Don\\'t you\\nfeel good?\\' she whispered, barely moving her lips.\\n\\n\\'No,\\' I said.  \\'I feel like hell.\\'\\n\\n\\'So do I, I\\'ll come back with you.\\'\\n\\nWe slipped out of our seats and said Excuse me Excuse me Excuse me down\\nthe length of our row, while the people grumbled and hissed and shifted\\ntheir rain boots and umbrellas to let us pass, and I stepped on as many\\nfeet as I could because it took my mind off this enormous desire to\\npuke that was ballooning up in front of me so fast I couldn\\'t see round\\nit.\\n\\nThe remains of a tepid rain were still sifting down when we stepped out\\ninto the street.\\n\\nBetsy looked a fright.  The bloom was gone from her cheeks and her\\ndrained face floated in front of me, green and sweating.  We fell into\\none of those yellow checkered cabs that are always waiting at the kerb\\nwhen you are trying to decide whether or not you want a taxi, and by\\nthe time we reached the hotel I had puked once and Betsy had puked\\ntwice.\\n\\nThe cab driver took the corners with such momentum that we were thrown\\ntogether first on one side of the back seat and then on the other.\\nEach time one of us felt sick, she would lean over quietly as if she\\nhad dropped something and was picking it up off the floor, and the\\nother one would hum a little and pretend to be looking out the window.\\n\\nThe cab driver seemed to know what we were doing, even so.\\n\\n\\'Hey,\\' he protested, driving through a light that had just turned red,\\n\\'you can\\'t do that in my cab, you better get out and do it in the\\nstreet.\\'\\n\\nBut we didn\\'t say anything, and I guess he figured we were almost at\\nthe hotel so he didn\\'t make us get out until we pulled up in front of\\nthe main entrance.\\n\\nWe didn\\'t dare wait to add up the fare.  We stuffed a pile of silver\\ninto the cabby\\'s hand and dropped a couple of kleenexes to cover the\\nmess on the floor, and ran in through the lobby and on to the empty\\nelevator.  Luckily for us, it was a quiet time of day.  Betsy was sick\\nagain in the elevator and I held her head, and then I was sick and she\\nheld mine.\\n\\nUsually after a good puke you feel better right away.  We hugged each\\nother and then said good-bye and went off to opposite ends of the hall\\nto lie down in our own rooms.  There is nothing like puking with\\nsomebody to make you into old friends.\\n\\nBut the minute I\\'d shut the door behind me and undressed and dragged\\nmyself on to the bed, I felt worse than ever.  I felt I just had to go\\nto the toilet.  I struggled into my white bathrobe with the blue\\ncornflowers on it and staggered down to the bathroom.\\n\\nBetsy was already there.  I could hear her groaning behind the door, so\\nI hurried on around the corner to the bathroom in the next wing.  I\\nthought I would die, it was so far.\\n\\nI sat on the toilet and leaned my head over the edge of the washbowl\\nand I thought I was losing my guts and my dinner both.  The sickness\\nrolled through me in great waves.  After each wave it would fade away\\nand leave me limp as a wet leaf and shivering all over and then I would\\nfeel it rising up in me again, and the glittering white torture-chamber\\ntiles under my feet and over my head and on all four sides closed in\\nand squeezed me to pieces.\\n\\nI don\\'t know how long I kept at it.  I let the cold water in the bowl\\ngo on running loudly with the stopper out, so anybody who came by would\\nthink I was washing my clothes, and then when I felt reasonably safe I\\nstretched out on the floor and lay quite still.\\n\\nIt didn\\'t seem to be summer any more.  I could feel the winter shaking\\nmy bones and banging my teeth together, and the big white hotel towel I\\nhad dragged down with me lay under my head numb as a snowdrift.\\n\\n\\nI thought it very bad manners for anybody to pound on a bathroom door\\nthe way some person was pounding.  They could just go around the corner\\nand find another bathroom the way I had done and leave me in peace.\\nBut the person kept banging and pleading with me to let them in and I\\nthought I dimly recognized the voice.  It sounded a bit like Emily Ann\\nOffenbach.\\n\\n\\'Just a minute,\\' I said then.  My words bungled out thick as molasses.\\n\\nI pulled myself together and slowly rose and flushed the toilet for the\\ntenth time and slopped the bowl clean and rolled up the towel so the\\nvomit stains didn\\'t show very clearly and unlocked the door and stepped\\nout into the hall.\\n\\nI knew it would be fatal if I looked at Emily Ann or anybody else so I\\nfixed my eyes glassily on a window that swam at the end of the hall and\\nput one foot in front of the other.\\n\\n\\nThe next thing I had a view of was somebody\\'s shoe.\\n\\nIt was a stout shoe of cracked black leather and quite old, with tiny\\nair holes in a scalloped pattern over the toe and a dull polish, and it\\nwas pointed at me.  It seemed to be placed on a hard green surface that\\nwas hurting my right cheekbone.\\n\\nI kept very still, waiting for a clue that would give me some notion of\\nwhat to do.  A little to the left of the shoe I saw a vague heap of\\nblue cornflowers on a white ground and this made me want to cry.  It\\nwas the sleeve of my own bathrobe I was looking at, and my left hand\\nlay pale as a cod at the end of it.\\n\\n\\'She\\'s all right now.\\'\\n\\nThe voice came from a cool, rational region far above my head.  For a\\nminute I didn\\'t think there was anything strange about it, and then I\\nthought it was strange.  It was a man\\'s voice, and no men were allowed\\nto be in our hotel at any time of the night or day.\\n\\n\\'How many others are there?\\' the voice went on.\\n\\nI listened with interest.  The floor seemed wonderfully solid.  It was\\ncomforting to know I had fallen and could fall no farther.\\n\\n\\'Eleven, I think,\\' a woman\\'s voice answered.  I figured she must belong\\nto the black shoe.  \\'I think there\\'s eleven more of \\'um, but one\\'s\\nmissin\\' so there\\'s oney ten.\\'\\n\\n\\'Well, you get this one to bed and I\\'ll take care of the rest.\\'\\n\\nI heard a hollow boomp boomp in my right ear that grew fainter and\\nfainter.  Then a door opened in the distance, and there were voices and\\ngroans, and the door shut again.\\n\\nTwo hands slid under my armpits and the woman\\'s voice said, \\'Come,\\ncome, lovey, we\\'ll make it yet,\\' and I felt myself being half lifted,\\nand slowly the doors began to move by, one by one, until we came to an\\nopen door and went in.\\n\\nThe sheet on my bed was folded back, and the woman helped me he down\\nand covered me up to the chin and rested for a minute in the bedside\\narmchair, fanning herself with one plump, pink hand.  She wore\\ngilt-rimmed spectacles and a white nurse\\'s cap.\\n\\n\\'Who are you?\\' I asked in a faint voice.\\n\\n\\'I\\'m the hotel nurse.\\'\\n\\n\\'What\\'s the matter with me?\\'\\n\\n\\'Poisoned,\\' she said briefly.  \\'Poisoned, the whole lot of you.  I\\nnever seen anythin\\' like it.  Sick here, sick there, whatever have you\\nyoung ladies been stuffin\\' yourselves with?\\'\\n\\n\\'Is everybody else sick too?\\' I asked with some hope.\\n\\n\\'The whole of your lot,\\' she affirmed with relish.  \\'Sick as dogs and\\ncryin\\' for ma.\\'\\n\\nThe room hovered around me with great gentleness, as if the chairs and\\nthe tables and the walls were withholding their weight out of sympathy\\nfor my sudden frailty.\\n\\n\\'The doctor\\'s given you a ninjection,\\' the nurse said from the doorway.\\n\\'You\\'ll sleep now.\\'\\n\\nAnd the door took her place like a sheet of blank paper, and then a\\nlarger sheet of paper took the place of the door, and I drifted toward\\nit and smiled myself to sleep.\\n\\n\\nSomebody was standing by my pillow with a white cup.\\n\\n\\'Drink this,\\' they said.\\n\\nI shook my head.  The pillow crackled like a wad of straw.\\n\\n\\'Drink this and you\\'ll feel better.\\'\\n\\nA thick white china cup was lowered under my nose.  In the wan light\\nthat might have been evening and might have been dawn I contemplated\\nthe clear amber liquid.  Pads of butter floated on the surface and a\\nfaint chickeny aroma fumed up to my nostrils.\\n\\nMy eyes moved tentatively to the skirt behind the cup.  \\'Betsy,\\' I said.\\n\\n\\'Betsy nothing, it\\'s me.\\'\\n\\nI raised my eyes then, and saw Doreen\\'s head silhouetted against the\\npaling window, her blonde hair lit at the tips from behind like a halo\\nof gold.  Her face was in shadow, so I couldn\\'t make out her\\nexpression, but I felt a sort of expert tenderness flowing from the\\nends of her fingers.  She might have been Betsy or my mother or a\\nfern-scented nurse.\\n\\nI bent my head and took a sip of the broth.  I thought my mouth must be\\nmade of sand.  I took another sip and then another and another until\\nthe cup was empty.\\n\\nI felt purged and holy and ready for a new life.\\n\\nDoreen set the cup on the window-sill and lowered herself into the\\narmchair.  I noticed that she made no move to take out a cigarette, and\\nas she was a chain-smoker this surprised me.\\n\\n\\'Well, you almost died,\\' she said finally.\\n\\n\\'I guess it was all that caviar.\\'\\n\\n\\'Caviar nothing!  It was the crabmeat.  They did tests on it and it was\\nchock-full of ptomaine.\\'\\n\\nI had a vision of the celestially white kitchens on _Ladies\\' Day_\\nstretching into infinity.  I saw avocado pear after avocado pear being\\nstuffed with crabmeat and mayonnaise and photographed under brilliant\\nlights.  I saw the delicate, pink-mottled claw-meat poking seductively\\nthrough its blanket of mayonnaise and the bland yellow pear cup with\\nits rim of alligator-green cradling the whole mess.\\n\\nPoison.\\n\\n\\'Who did tests?\\'  I thought the doctor might have pumped somebody\\'s\\nstomach and then analyzed what he found in his hotel laboratory.\\n\\n\\'Those dodos on _Ladies\\' Day_.  As soon as you all started keeling over\\nlike ninepins somebody called into the office and the office called\\nacross to _Ladies\\' Day_ and they did tests on everything left over from\\nthe big lunch.  Ha!\\'\\n\\n\\'Ha!\\' I echoed hollowly.  It was good to have Doreen back.\\n\\n\\'They sent presents,\\' she added.  \\'They\\'re in a big carton out in the\\nhall.\\'\\n\\n\\'How did they get here so fast?\\'\\n\\n\\'Special express delivery, what do you think?  They can\\'t afford to\\nhave the lot of you running around saying you got poisoned at _Ladies\\'\\nDay_.  You could sue them for every penny they own if you just knew\\nsome smart law man.\\'\\n\\n\\'What are the presents?\\'  I began to feel if it was a good enough\\npresent I wouldn\\'t mind about what happened, because I felt so pure as\\na result.\\n\\nNobody\\'s opened the box yet, they\\'re all out flat.  I\\'m supposed to be\\ncarting soup into everybody, seeing as I\\'m the only one on my feet, but\\nI brought you yours first.\\'\\n\\n\\'See what the present is,\\' I begged.  Then I remembered and said, \\'I\\'ve\\na present for you as well.\\'\\n\\nDoreen went out into the hall.  I could hear her rustling around for a\\nminute and then the sound of paper tearing.  Finally she came back\\ncarrying a thick book with a glossy cover and people\\'s names printed\\nall over it.\\n\\n\\'_The Thirty Best Short Stories of the Year._\\'  She dropped the book in\\nmy lap.  \\'There\\'s eleven more of them out there in that box.  I suppose\\nthey thought it\\'d give you something to read while you were sick.\\'  She\\npaused.  \\'Where\\'s mine?\\'\\n\\nI fished in my pocket-book and handed Doreen the mirror with her name\\nand the daisies on it.  Doreen looked at me and I looked at her and we\\nboth burst out laughing.\\n\\n\\'You can have my soup if you want,\\' she said.  \\'They put twelve soups\\non the tray by mistake and Lenny and I stuffed down so many hotdogs\\nwhile we were waiting for the rain to stop I couldn\\'t eat another\\nmouthful.\\'\\n\\n\\'Bring it in,\\' I said.  \\'I\\'m starving.\\'\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter Five\\n\\nAt seven the next morning the telephone rang.\\n\\nSlowly I swam up from the bottom of a black sleep.  I already had a\\ntelegram from Jay Cee stuck in my mirror, telling me not to bother to\\ncome into work but to rest for a day and get completely well, and how\\nsorry she was about the bad crabmeat, so I couldn\\'t imagine who would\\nbe calling.\\n\\nI reached out and hitched the receiver on to my pillow so the\\nmouthpiece rested on my collarbone and the earpiece lay on my shoulder.\\n\\n\\'Hello?\\'\\n\\nA man\\'s voice said, \\'Is that Miss Esther Greenwood?\\'  I thought I\\ndetected a slight foreign accent.\\n\\n\\'It certainly is,\\' I said.\\n\\n\\'This is Constantin Something-or-Other.\\'\\n\\nI couldn\\'t make out the last name, but it was full of S\\'s and K\\'s.  I\\ndidn\\'t know any Constantin, but I hadn\\'t the heart to say so.\\n\\nThen I remembered Mrs Willard and her simultaneous interpreter.\\n\\n\\'Of course, of course!\\' I cried, sitting up and clutching the phone to\\nme with both hands.\\n\\nI\\'d never have given Mrs Willard credit for introducing me to a man\\nnamed Constantin.\\n\\nI collected men with interesting names.  I already knew a Socrates.  He\\nwas tall and ugly and intellectual and the son of some big Greek movie\\nproducer in Hollywood, but also a Catholic, which ruined it for both of\\nus.  In addition to Socrates I knew a White Russian named Attila at the\\nBoston School of Business Administration.\\n\\nGradually I realized that Constantin was trying to arrange a meeting\\nfor us later in the day.\\n\\n\\'Would you like to see the UN this afternoon?\\'\\n\\n\\'I can already see the UN,\\' I told him, with a little hysterical giggle.\\n\\nHe seemed nonplussed.\\n\\n\\'I can see it from my window.\\'  I thought perhaps my English was a\\ntouch too fast for him.\\n\\nThere was a silence.\\n\\nThen he said, \\'Maybe you would like a bite to eat afterwards.\\'\\n\\nI detected the vocabulary of Mrs Willard and my heart sank.  Mrs\\nWillard always invited you for a bite to eat.  I remembered that this\\nman had been a guest at Mrs Willard\\'s house when he first came to\\nAmerica--Mrs Willard had one of these arrangements where you open your\\nhouse to foreigners and then when you go abroad they open their houses\\nto you.\\n\\nI now saw quite clearly that Mrs Willard had simply traded her open\\nhouse in Russia for my bite to eat in New York.\\n\\n\\'Yes, I would like a bite to eat,\\' I said stiffly.  \\'What time will you\\ncome?\\'\\n\\n\\'I\\'ll call for you in my car about two.  It\\'s the Amazon, isn\\'t it?\\'\\n\\n\\'Yes.\\'\\n\\n\\'Ah, I know where that is.\\'\\n\\nFor a moment I thought his tone was laden with special meaning, and\\nthen I figured that probably some of the girls at the Amazon were\\nsecretaries at the UN and maybe he had taken one of them out at one\\ntime.  I let him hang up first, and then I hung up and lay back in the\\npillows, feeling grim.\\n\\nThere I went again, building up a glamorous picture of a man who would\\nlove me passionately the minute he met me, and all out of a few prosy\\nnothings.  A duty tour of the UN and a post-UN sandwich!\\n\\nI tried to jack up my morale.\\n\\nProbably Mrs Willard\\'s simultaneous interpreter would be short and ugly\\nand I would come to look down on him in the end the way I looked down\\non Buddy Willard.  This thought gave me a certain satisfaction.\\nBecause I did look down on Buddy Willard, and although everybody still\\nthought I would marry him when he came out of the TB place, I knew I\\nwould never marry him if he were the last man on earth.\\n\\nBuddy Willard was a hypocrite.\\n\\nOf course, I didn\\'t know he was a hypocrite at first.  I thought he was\\nthe most wonderful boy I\\'d ever seen.  I\\'d adored him from a distance\\nfor five years before he even looked at me, and then there was a\\nbeautiful time when I still adored him and he started looking at me,\\nand then just as he was looking at me more and more I discovered quite\\nby accident what an awful hypocrite he was, and now he wanted me to\\nmarry him and I hated his guts.\\n\\nThe worst part of it was I couldn\\'t come straight out and tell him what\\nI thought of him, because he caught TB before I could do that, and now\\nI had to humour him along till he got well again and could take the\\nunvarnished truth.\\n\\nI decided not to go down to the cafeteria for breakfast.  It would only\\nmean getting dressed, and what was the point of getting dressed if you\\nwere staying in bed for the morning?  I could have called down and\\nasked for a breakfast tray in my room, I guess, but then I would have\\nto tip the person who brought it up and I never knew how much to tip.\\nI\\'d had some very unsettling experiences trying to tip people in New\\nYork.\\n\\nWhen I first arrived at the Amazon a dwarfish, bald man in a bellhop\\'s\\nuniform carried my suitcase up in the elevator and unlocked my room for\\nme.  Of course I rushed immediately to the window and looked out to see\\nwhat the view was.  After a while I was aware of this bellhop turning\\non the hot and cold taps in my washbowl and saying \\'This is the hot and\\nthis is the cold\\' and switching on the radio and telling me the names\\nof all the New York stations and I began to get uneasy, so I kept my\\nback to him and said firmly, \\'Thank you for bringing up my suitcase.\\'\\n\\n\\'Thank you thank you thank you.  Ha!\\' he said in a very nasty\\ninsinuating tone, and before I could wheel round to see what had come\\nover him he was gone, shutting the door behind him with a rude slam.\\n\\nLater, when I told Doreen about his curious behaviour, she said, \\'You\\nninny, he wanted his tip.\\'\\n\\nI asked how much I should have given and she said a quarter at least\\nand thirty-five cents if the suitcase was too heavy.  Now I could have\\ncarried that suitcase to my room perfectly well by myself, only the\\nbellhop seemed so eager to do it that I let him.  I thought that sort\\nof service came along with what you paid for your hotel room.\\n\\nI hate handing over money to people for doing what I could just as\\neasily do myself, it makes me nervous.\\n\\nDoreen said ten per cent was what you should tip a person, but I\\nsomehow never had the right change and I\\'d have felt awfully silly\\ngiving somebody half a dollar and saying, \\'Fifteen cents of this is a\\ntip for you, please give me thirty-five cents back.\\'\\n\\nThe first time I took a taxi in New York I tipped the driver ten cents.\\nThe fare was a dollar, so I thought ten cents was exactly right and\\ngave the driver my dime with a little flourish and a smile.  But he\\nonly held it in the palm of his hand and stared and stared at it, and\\nwhen I stepped out of the cab, hoping I had not handed him a Canadian\\ndime by mistake, he started yelling, \\'Lady I gotta live like you and\\neverybody else,\\' in a loud voice which scared me so much I broke into a\\nrun.  Luckily he was stopped at a traffic light or I think he would\\nhave driven along beside me yelling in that embarrassing way.\\n\\nWhen I asked Doreen about this she said the tipping percentage might\\nwell have risen from ten to fifteen per cent since she was last in New\\nYork.  Either that, or that particular cab-driver was an out and out\\nlouse.\\n\\n\\nI reached for the book the people from _Ladies\\' Day_ had sent.\\n\\nWhen I opened it a card fell out.  The front of the card showed a\\npoodle in a flowered bedjacket sitting in a poodle basket with a sad\\nface, and the inside of the card showed the poodle lying down in the\\nbasket with a little smile, sound asleep under an embroidered sampler\\nthat said, \\'You\\'ll get well best with lots and lots of rest\\'.  At the\\nbottom of the card somebody had written, \\'Get well quick! from all of\\nyour good friends at _Ladies\\' Day_\\' in lavender ink.\\n\\nI flipped through one story after another until finally I came to a\\nstory about a fig-tree.\\n\\nThis fig-tree grew on a green lawn between the house of a Jewish man\\nand a convent, and the Jewish man and a beautiful dark nun kept meeting\\nat the tree to pick the ripe figs, until one day they saw an egg\\nhatching in a bird\\'s nest on a branch of the tree, and as they watched\\nthe little bird peck its way out of the egg, they touched the backs of\\ntheir hands together, and then the nun didn\\'t come out to pick figs\\nwith the Jewish man any more but a mean-faced Catholic kitchen-maid\\ncame to pick them instead and counted up the figs the man picked after\\nthey were both through to be sure he hadn\\'t picked any more than she\\nhad, and the man was furious.\\n\\nI thought it was a lovely story, especially the part about the fig-tree\\nin winter under the snow and then the fig-tree in spring with all the\\ngreen fruit.  I felt sorry when I came to the last page.  I wanted to\\ncrawl in between those black lines of print the way you crawl through a\\nfence, and go to sleep under that beautiful big green fig-tree.\\n\\nIt seemed to me Buddy Willard and I were like that Jewish man and that\\nnun, although of course we weren\\'t Jewish or Catholic but Unitarian.\\nWe had met together under our own imaginary fig-tree, and what we had\\nseen wasn\\'t a bird coming out of an egg but a baby coming out of a\\nwoman, and then something awful happened and we went our separate ways.\\n\\nAs I lay there in my white hotel bed feeling lonely and weak, I thought\\nof Buddy Willard lying even lonelier and weaker than I was up in that\\nsanatorium in the Adirondacks, and I felt like a heel of the worst\\nsort.  In his letters Buddy kept telling me how he was reading poems by\\na poet who was also a doctor and how he\\'d found out about some famous\\ndead Russian short story writer who had been a doctor too, so maybe\\ndoctors and writers could get along fine after all.\\n\\nNow this was a very different tune from what Buddy Willard had been\\nsinging all the two years we were getting to know each other.  I\\nremember the day he smiled at me and said, \\'Do you know what a poem is,\\nEsther?\\'\\n\\n\\'No, what?\\' I said.\\n\\n\\'A piece of dust.\\'  And he looked so proud of having thought of this\\nthat I just stared at his blond hair and his blue eyes and his white\\nteeth--he had very long, strong white teeth--and said \\'I guess so.\\'\\n\\nIt was only in the middle of New York a whole year later that I finally\\nthought of an answer to that remark.\\n\\nI spent a lot of time having imaginary conversations with Buddy\\nWillard.  He was a couple of years older than I was and very\\nscientific, so he could always prove things.  When I was with him I had\\nto work to keep my head above water.\\n\\nThese conversations I had in my mind usually repeated the beginnings of\\nconversations I\\'d really had with Buddy, only they finished with me\\nanswering him back quite sharply, instead of just sitting around and\\nsaying \\'I guess so\\'.\\n\\nNow, lying on my back in bed, I imagined Buddy saying, \\'Do you know\\nwhat a poem is, Esther?\\'\\n\\n\\'No, what?\\' I would say.\\n\\n\\'A piece of dust.\\'\\n\\nThen just as he was smiling and starting to look proud, I would say,\\n\\'So are the cadavers you cut up.  So are the people you think you\\'re\\ncuring.  They\\'re dust as dust as dust.  I reckon a good poem lasts a\\nwhole lot longer than a hundred of those people put together.\\'\\n\\nAnd of course Buddy wouldn\\'t have any answer to that, because what I\\nsaid was true.  People were made of nothing so much as dust, and I\\ncouldn\\'t see that doctoring all that dust was a bit better than writing\\npoems people would remember and repeat to themselves when they were\\nunhappy or sick and couldn\\'t sleep.\\n\\nMy trouble was I took everything Buddy Willard told me as the\\nhonest-to-God truth.  I remember the first night he kissed me.  It was\\nafter the Yale Junior Prom.\\n\\nIt was strange, the way Buddy had invited me to that Prom.\\n\\nHe popped into my house out of the blue one Christmas vacation, wearing\\na thick white turtleneck sweater and looking so handsome I could hardly\\nstop staring and said, \\'I might drop over to see you at college some\\nday, all right?\\'\\n\\nI was flabbergasted.  I only saw Buddy at church on Sundays when we\\nwere both home from college, and then at a distance, and I couldn\\'t\\nfigure what had put it into his head to run over and see me--he had run\\nthe two miles between our houses for cross-country practice, he said.\\n\\nOf course, our mothers were good friends.  They had gone to school\\ntogether and then both married their professors and settled down in the\\nsame town, but Buddy was always off on a scholarship at prep school in\\nthe fall or earning money by fighting blister rust in Montana in the\\nsummer, so our mothers being old school chums really didn\\'t matter a\\nbit.\\n\\nAfter this sudden visit I didn\\'t hear a word from Buddy until one fine\\nSaturday morning in early March.  I was up in my room at college,\\nstudying about Peter the Hermit and Walter the Penniless for my history\\nexam on the crusades the coming Monday when the hall phone rang.\\n\\nUsually people are supposed to take turns answering the hall phone, but\\nas I was the only freshman on a floor with all seniors they made me\\nanswer it most of the time.  I waited a minute to see if anybody would\\nbeat me to it.  Then I figured everybody was probably out playing\\nsquash or away on week-ends, so I answered it myself.\\n\\n\\'Is that you, Esther?\\' the girl on watch downstairs said, and when I\\nsaid Yes, she said, \\'There\\'s a man to see you.\\'\\n\\nI was surprised to hear this, because of all the blind dates I\\'d had\\nthat year not one called me up again for a second date.  I just didn\\'t\\nhave any luck.  I hated coming downstairs sweaty-handed and curious\\nevery Saturday night and having some senior introduce me to her aunt\\'s\\nbest friend\\'s son and finding some pale, mushroomy fellow with\\nprotruding ears or buck teeth or a bad leg.  I didn\\'t think I deserved\\nit.  After all, I wasn\\'t crippled in any way, I just studied too hard,\\nI didn\\'t know when to stop.\\n\\nWell, I combed my hair and put on some more lipstick and took my\\nhistory book--so I could say I was on my way to the library if it\\nturned out to be somebody awful--and went down, and there was Buddy\\nWillard leaning against the mail table in a khaki zipper jacket and\\nblue dungarees and frayed grey sneakers and grinning up at me.\\n\\n\\'I just came over to say hello,\\' he said.\\n\\nI thought it odd he should come all the way up from Yale even\\nhitch-hiking, as he did, to save money, just to say hello.\\n\\n\\'Hello,\\' I said.  \\'Let\\'s go out and sit on the porch.\\'\\n\\nI wanted to go out on the porch because the girl on watch was a nosey\\nsenior and eyeing me curiously.  She obviously thought Buddy had made a\\nbig mistake.\\n\\nWe sat side by side in two wicker rocking-chairs.  The sunlight was\\nclean and windless and almost hot.\\n\\n\\'I can\\'t stay more than a few minutes,\\' Buddy said.\\n\\n\\'Oh, come on, stay for lunch,\\' I said.\\n\\n\\'Oh, I can\\'t do that.  I\\'m up here for the Sophomore Prom with Joan.\\'\\n\\nI felt like a prize idiot.\\n\\n\\'How is Joan?\\' I asked coldly.\\n\\nJoan Gilling came from our home town and went to our church and was a\\nyear ahead of me at college.  She was a big wheel--president of her\\nclass and a physics major and the college hockey champion.  She always\\nmade me feel squirmy with her starey pebble-coloured eyes and her\\ngleaming tombstone teeth and her breathy voice.  She was big as a\\nhorse, too.  I began to think Buddy had pretty poor taste.\\n\\n\\'Oh Joan,\\' he said.  \\'She asked me up to this dance two months ahead of\\ntime and her mother asked my mother if I would take her, so what could\\nI do?\\'\\n\\n\\'Well, why did you say you\\'d take her if you didn\\'t want to?\\' I asked\\nmeanly.\\n\\n\\'Oh, I like Joan.  She never cares whether you spend any money on her\\nor not and she enjoys doing things out-of-doors.  The last time she\\ncame down to Yale for house week-end we went on a bicycle trip to East\\nRock and she\\'s the only girl I haven\\'t had to push up hills.  Joan\\'s\\nall right.\\'\\n\\nI went cold with envy.  I had never been to Yale, and Yale was the\\nplace all the seniors in my house liked to go best on week-ends.  I\\ndecided to expect nothing from Buddy Willard.  If you expect nothing\\nfrom somebody you are never disappointed.\\n\\n\\'You better go and find Joan then,\\' I said in a matter-of-fact voice.\\n\\'I\\'ve a date coming any minute and he won\\'t like seeing me sitting\\naround with you.\\'\\n\\n\\'A date?\\'  Buddy looked surprised.  \\'Who is it?\\'\\n\\n\\'It\\'s two,\\' I said, \\'Peter the Hermit and Walter the Penniless.\\'\\n\\nBuddy didn\\'t say anything, so I said, \\'Those are their nicknames.\\'\\n\\nThen I added, \\'They\\'re from Dartmouth.\\'\\n\\nI guess Buddy never read much history, because his mouth stiffened.  He\\nswung up from the wicker rocking-chair and gave it a sharp little\\nunnecessary push.  Then he dropped a pale blue envelope with a Yale\\ncrest into my lap.\\n\\n\\'Here\\'s a letter I meant to leave for you if you weren\\'t in.  There\\'s a\\nquestion in it you can answer by mail.  I don\\'t feel like asking you\\nabout it right now.\\'\\n\\nAfter Buddy had gone I opened the letter.  It was a letter inviting me\\nto the Yale Junior Prom.\\n\\nI was so surprised I let out a couple of yips and ran into the house\\nshouting, \\'I\\'m going I\\'m going I\\'m going.\\'  After the bright white sun\\non the porch it looked pitch-dark in there, and I couldn\\'t make out a\\nthing.  I found myself hugging the senior on watch.  When she heard I\\nwas going to the Yale Junior Prom she treated me with amazement and\\nrespect.\\n\\nOddly enough, things changed in the house after that.  The seniors on\\nmy floor started speaking to me and every now and then one of them\\nwould answer the phone quite spontaneously and nobody made any more\\nnasty loud remarks outside my door about people wasting their golden\\ncollege days with their noses stuck in a book.\\n\\nWell all during the Junior Prom Buddy treated me like a friend or a\\ncousin.\\n\\nWe danced about a mile apart the whole time, until during \\'Auld Lang\\nSyne\\' he suddenly rested his chin on the top of my head as if he were\\nvery tired.  Then in the cold, black, three o\\'clock wind we walked very\\nslowly the five miles back to the house where I was sleeping in the\\nliving-room on a couch that was too short because it only cost fifty\\ncents a night instead of two dollars like most of the other places with\\nproper beds.\\n\\nI felt dull and flat and full of shattered visions.\\n\\nI had imagined Buddy would fall in love with me that week-end and that\\nI wouldn\\'t have to worry about what I was doing on any more Saturday\\nnights the rest of the year.  Just as we approached the house where I\\nwas staying Buddy said, \\'Let\\'s go up to the chemistry lab.\\'\\n\\nI was aghast.  \\'The _chem_istry lab?\\'\\n\\n\\'Yes.\\'  Buddy reached for my hand.  \\'There\\'s a beautiful view up there\\nbehind the chemistry lab.\\'\\n\\nAnd sure enough, there was a sort of hilly place behind the chemistry\\nlab from which you could see the lights of a couple of the houses in\\nNew Haven.\\n\\nI stood pretending to admire them while Buddy got a good footing on the\\nrough soil.  While he kissed me I kept my eyes open and tried to\\nmemorize the spacing of the house lights so I would never forget them.\\n\\nFinally Buddy stepped back.  \\'Wow!\\' he said.\\n\\n\\'Wow what?\\' I said, surprised.  It had been a dry, uninspiring little\\nkiss, and I remember thinking it was too bad both our mouths were so\\nchapped from walking five miles in that cold wind.\\n\\n\\'Wow, it makes me feel terrific to kiss you.\\'\\n\\nI modestly didn\\'t say anything.\\n\\n\\'I guess you go out with a lot of boys,\\' Buddy said then.\\n\\n\\'Well, I guess I do.\\'  I thought I must have gone out with a different\\nboy for every week in the year.\\n\\n\\'Well, I have to study a lot.\\'\\n\\n\\'So do I,\\' I put in hastily.  \\'I have to keep my scholarship after all.\\'\\n\\n\\'Still, I think I could manage to see you every third week-end.\\'\\n\\n\\'That\\'s nice.\\'  I was almost fainting and dying to get back to college\\nand tell everybody.\\n\\nBuddy kissed me again in front of the house steps, and the next fall,\\nwhen his scholarship to Medical School came through, I went there to\\nsee him instead of to Yale and it was there I found out how he had\\nfooled me all those years and what a hypocrite he was.\\n\\nI found out on the day we saw the baby born.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter Six\\n\\nI had kept begging Buddy to show me some really interesting hospital\\nsights, so one Friday I cut all my classes and came down for a long\\nweek-end and he gave me the works.\\n\\nI started out by dressing in a white coat and sitting on a tall stool\\nin a room with four cadavers, while Buddy and his friends cut them up.\\nThese cadavers were so unhuman-looking they didn\\'t bother me a bit.\\nThey had stiff, leathery, purple-black skin and they smelt like old\\npickle jars.\\n\\nAfter that, Buddy took me out into a hall where they had some big glass\\nbottles full of babies that had died before they were born.  The baby\\nin the first bottle had a large white head bent over a tiny curled-up\\nbody the size of a frog.  The baby in the next bottle was bigger and\\nthe baby next to that one was bigger still and the baby in the last\\nbottle was the size of a normal baby and he seemed to be looking at me\\nand smiling a little piggy smile.\\n\\nI was quite proud of the calm way I stared at all these gruesome\\nthings.  The only time I jumped was when I leaned my elbow on Buddy\\'s\\ncadaver\\'s stomach to watch him dissect a lung.  After a minute or two I\\nfelt this burning sensation in my elbow and it occurred to me the\\ncadaver might just be half alive since it was still warm, so I leapt\\noff my stool with a small exclamation.  Then Buddy explained the\\nburning was only from the pickling fluid, and I sat back in my old\\nposition.\\n\\nIn the hour before lunch Buddy took me to a lecture on sickle cell\\nanaemia and some other depressing diseases, where they wheeled sick\\npeople out on to the platform and asked them questions and then wheeled\\nthem off and showed coloured slides.\\n\\nOne slide I remember showed a beautiful laughing girl with a black mole\\non her cheek.  \\'Twenty days after that mole appeared the girl was\\ndead,\\' the doctor said, and everybody went very quiet for a minute and\\nthen the bell rang, so I never really found out what the mole was or\\nwhy the girl died.\\n\\nIn the afternoon we went to see a baby born.\\n\\nFirst we found a linen closet in the hospital corridor where Buddy took\\nout a white mask for me to wear and some gauze.\\n\\nA tall fat medical student, big as Sidney Greenstreet, lounged nearby,\\nwatching Buddy wind the gauze round and round my head until my hair was\\ncompletely covered and only my eyes peered out over the white mask.\\n\\nThe medical student gave an unpleasant little snicker.  \\'At least your\\nmother loves you,\\' he said.\\n\\nI was so busy thinking how very fat he was and how unfortunate it must\\nbe for a man and especially a young man to be fat, because what woman\\ncould stand leaning over that big stomach to kiss him, that I didn\\'t\\nimmediately realize what this student had said to me was an insult.  By\\nthe time I figured he must consider himself quite a fine fellow and had\\nthought up a cutting remark about how only a mother loves a fat man, he\\nwas gone.\\n\\nBuddy was examining a queer wooden plaque on the wall with a row of\\nholes in it, starting from a hole about the size of a silver dollar and\\nending with one the size of a dinner-plate.\\n\\n\\'Fine, fine,\\' he said to me.  \\'There\\'s somebody about to have a baby\\nthis minute.\\'\\n\\nAt the door of the delivery room stood a thin, stoop-shouldered medical\\nstudent Buddy knew.\\n\\n\\'Hello, Will,\\' Buddy said.  \\'Who\\'s on the job?\\'\\n\\n\\'I am,\\' Will said gloomily, and I noticed little drops of sweat beading\\nhis high pale forehead.  \\'I am, and it\\'s my first.\\'\\n\\nBuddy told me Will was a third-year man and had to deliver eight babies\\nbefore he could graduate.\\n\\nThen we noticed a bustle at the far end of the hall and some men in\\nlime-green coats and skull-caps and a few nurses came moving towards us\\nin a ragged procession wheeling a trolley with a big white lump on it.\\n\\n\\'You oughtn\\'t to see this,\\' Will muttered in my ear.  \\'You\\'ll never\\nwant to have a baby if you do.  They oughtn\\'t to let women watch.\\nIt\\'ll be the end of the human race.\\'\\n\\nBuddy and I laughed, and then Buddy shook Will\\'s hand and we all went\\ninto the room.\\n\\nI was so struck by the sight of the table where they were lifting the\\nwoman I didn\\'t say a word.  It looked like some awful torture table,\\nwith these metal stirrups sticking up in mid-air at one end and all\\nsorts of instruments and wires and tubes I couldn\\'t make out properly\\nat the other.\\n\\nBuddy and I stood together by the window, a few feet away from the\\nwoman, where we had a perfect view.\\n\\nThe woman\\'s stomach stuck up so high I couldn\\'t see her face or the\\nupper part of her body at all.  She seemed to have nothing but an\\nenormous spider-fat stomach and two little ugly spindly legs propped in\\nthe high stirrups, and all the time the baby was being born she never\\nstopped making this unhuman whooing noise.\\n\\nLater Buddy told me the woman was on a drug that would make her forget\\nshe\\'d had any pain and that when she swore and groaned she really\\ndidn\\'t know what she was doing because she was in a kind of twilight\\nsleep.\\n\\nI thought it sounded just like the sort of drug a man would invent.\\nHere was a woman in terrible pain, obviously feeling every bit of it or\\nshe wouldn\\'t groan like that, and she would go straight home and start\\nanother baby, because the drug would make her forget how bad the pain\\nhad been, when all the time, in some secret part of her, that long,\\nblind, doorless and windowless corridor of pain was waiting to open up\\nand shut her in again.\\n\\nThe head doctor, who was supervising Will, kept saying to the woman,\\n\\'Push down, Mrs Tomolillo, push down, that\\'s a good girl, push down,\\'\\nand finally through the split, shaven place between her legs, lurid\\nwith disinfectant, I saw a dark fuzzy thing appear.\\n\\n\\'The baby\\'s head,\\' Buddy whispered under cover of the woman\\'s groans.\\n\\nBut the baby\\'s head stuck for some reason, and the doctor told Will\\nhe\\'d have to make a cut.  I heard the scissors close on the woman\\'s\\nskin like cloth and the blood began to run down--a fierce, bright red.\\nThen all at once the baby seemed to pop out into Will\\'s hands, the\\ncolour of a blue plum and floured with white stuff and streaked with\\nblood, and Will kept saying, \\'I\\'m going to drop it, I\\'m going to drop\\nit, I\\'m going to drop it,\\' in a terrified voice.\\n\\n\\'No, you\\'re not,\\' the doctor said, and took the baby out of Will\\'s\\nhands and started massaging it, and the blue colour went away and the\\nbaby started to cry in a lorn, croaky voice and I could see it was a\\nboy.\\n\\nThe first thing that baby did was pee in the doctor\\'s face.  I told\\nBuddy later I didn\\'t see how that was possible, but he said it was\\nquite possible, though unusual, to see something like that happen.\\n\\nAs soon as the baby was born the people in the room divided up into two\\ngroups, the nurses tying a metal dog-tag on the baby\\'s wrist and\\nswabbing its eyes with cotton on the end of a stick and wrapping it up\\nand putting it in a canvas-sided cot, while the doctor and Will started\\nsewing up the woman\\'s cut with a needle and a long thread.\\n\\nI think somebody said, \\'It\\'s a boy, Mrs Tomolillo,\\' but the woman\\ndidn\\'t answer or raise her head.\\n\\n\\'Well, how was it?\\' Buddy asked with a satisfied expression as we\\nwalked across the green quadrangle to his room.\\n\\n\\'Wonderful,\\' I said.  \\'I could see something like that every day.\\'\\n\\nI didn\\'t feel up to asking him if there were any other ways to have\\nbabies.  For some reason the most important thing to me was actually\\nseeing the baby come out of you yourself and making sure it was yours.\\nI thought if you had to have all that pain anyway you might just as\\nwell stay awake.\\n\\nI had always imagined myself hitching up on to my elbows on the\\ndelivery table after it was all over--dead white, of course, with no\\nmake-up and from the awful ordeal, but smiling and radiant, with my\\nhair down to my waist, and reaching out for my first little squirmy\\nchild and saying its name, whatever it was.\\n\\n\\'Why was it all covered with flour?\\' I asked then, to keep the\\nconversation going, and Buddy told me about the waxy stuff that guarded\\nthe baby\\'s skin.\\n\\nWhen we were back in Buddy\\'s room, which reminded me of nothing so much\\nas a monk\\'s cell, with its bare walls and bare bed and bare floor and\\nthe desk loaded with Gray\\'s Anatomy and other thick gruesome books,\\nBuddy lit a candle and uncorked a bottle of Dubonnet.  Then we lay down\\nside by side on the bed and Buddy sipped his wine while I read aloud\\n\\'somewhere I have never travelled\\' and other poems from a book I\\'d\\nbrought.\\n\\nBuddy said he figured there must be something in poetry if a girl like\\nme spent all her days over it, so each time we met I read him some\\npoetry and explained to him what I found in it.  It was Buddy\\'s idea.\\nHe always arranged our week-ends so we\\'d never regret wasting our time\\nin any way.  Buddy\\'s father was a teacher, and I think Buddy could have\\nbeen a teacher as well, he was always trying to explain things to me\\nand introduce me to new knowledge.\\n\\nSuddenly, after I finished a poem, he said, \\'Esther, have you ever seen\\na man?\\'\\n\\nThe way he said it I knew he didn\\'t mean a regular man or a man in\\ngeneral, I knew he meant a man naked.\\n\\n\\'No,\\' I said.  \\'Only statues.\\'\\n\\n\\'Well, don\\'t you think you would like to see me?\\'\\n\\nI didn\\'t know what to say.  My mother and my grandmother had started\\nhinting around to me a lot lately about what a fine, clean boy Buddy\\nWillard was, coming from such a fine, clean family, and how everybody\\nat church thought he was a model person, so kind to his parents and to\\nolder people, as well as so athletic and so handsome and so intelligent.\\n\\nAll I\\'d heard about, really, was how fine and clean Buddy was and how\\nhe was the kind of person a girl should stay fine and clean for.  So I\\ndidn\\'t really see the harm in anything Buddy would think up to do.\\n\\n\\'Well, all right, I guess so,\\' I said.\\n\\nI stared at Buddy while he unzipped his chino pants and took them off\\nand laid them on a chair and then took off his underpants that were\\nmade of something like nylon fishnet.\\n\\n\\'They\\'re cool,\\' he explained, \\'and my mother says they wash easily.\\'\\n\\nThen he just stood there in front of me and I kept on staring at him.\\nThe only thing I could think of was turkey neck and turkey gizzards and\\nI felt very depressed.\\n\\nBuddy seemed hurt I didn\\'t say anything.  \\'I think you ought to get\\nused to me like this,\\' he said.  \\'Now let me see you.\\'\\n\\nBut undressing in front of Buddy suddenly appealed to me about as much\\nas having my Posture Picture taken at college, where you have to stand\\nnaked in front of a camera, knowing all the time that a picture of you\\nstark naked, both full view and side view, is going into the college\\ngym files to be marked A B C or D depending on how straight you are.\\n\\n\\'Oh, some other time,\\' I said.\\n\\n\\'All right.\\'  Buddy got dressed again.\\n\\nThen we kissed and hugged a while and I felt a little better.  I drank\\nthe rest of the Dubonnet and sat cross-legged at the end of Buddy\\'s bed\\nand asked for a comb.  I began to comb my hair down over my face so\\nBuddy couldn\\'t see it.  Suddenly I said, \\'Have you ever had an affair\\nwith anyone, Buddy?\\'\\n\\nI don\\'t know what made me say it, the words just popped out of my\\nmouth.  I never thought for one minute that Buddy Willard would have an\\naffair with anyone.  I expected him to say, \\'No, I have been saving\\nmyself for when I get married to somebody pure and a virgin like you\\'.\\n\\nBut Buddy didn\\'t say anything, he just turned pink.\\n\\n\\'Well, have you?\\'\\n\\n\\'What do you mean, an affair?\\' Buddy asked then in a hollow voice.\\n\\n\\'You know, have you ever gone to bed with anyone?\\'  I kept rhythmically\\ncombing the hair down over the side of my face nearest to Buddy, and I\\ncould feel the little electric filaments clinging to my hot cheeks and\\nI wanted to shout, \\'Stop, stop, don\\'t tell me, don\\'t say anything.\\'\\nBut I didn\\'t, I just kept still.\\n\\n\\'Well, yes, I have,\\' Buddy said finally.\\n\\nI almost fell over.  From the first night Buddy Willard kissed me and\\nsaid I must go out with a lot of boys, he made me feel I was much more\\nsexy and experienced than he was and that everything he did like\\nhugging and kissing and petting was simply what I made him feel like\\ndoing out of the blue, he couldn\\'t help it and didn\\'t know how it came\\nabout.\\n\\nNow I saw he had only been pretending all this time to be so innocent.\\n\\n\\'Tell me about it.\\'  I combed my hair slowly over and over, feeling the\\nteeth of the comb dig into my cheek at every stroke.  \\'Who was it?\\'\\n\\nBuddy seemed relieved I wasn\\'t angry.  He even seemed relieved to have\\nsomebody to tell about how he was seduced.\\n\\nOf course, somebody had seduced Buddy, Buddy hadn\\'t started it and it\\nwasn\\'t really his fault.  It was this waitress at the hotel he worked\\nat as a busboy the last summer on Cape Cod.  Buddy had noticed her\\nstaring at him queerly and shoving her breasts up against him in the\\nconfusion of the kitchen, so finally one day he asked her what the\\ntrouble was and she looked him straight in the eye and said, \\'I want\\nyou.\\'\\n\\n\\'Served up with parsley?\\'  Buddy had laughed innocently.\\n\\n\\'No,\\' she had said.  \\'Some night.\\'\\n\\nAnd that\\'s how Buddy had lost his pureness and his virginity.\\n\\nAt first I thought he must have slept with the waitress only the once,\\nbut when I asked how many times, just to make sure, he said he couldn\\'t\\nremember but a couple of times a week for the rest of the summer.  I\\nmultiplied three by ten and got thirty, which seemed beyond all reason.\\n\\nAfter that something in me just froze up.\\n\\nBack at college I started asking a senior here and a senior there what\\nthey would do if a boy they knew suddenly told them he\\'d slept thirty\\ntimes with some slutty waitress one summer, smack in the middle of\\nknowing them.  But these seniors said most boys were like that and you\\ncouldn\\'t honestly accuse them of anything until you were at least\\npinned or engaged to be married.\\n\\nActually, it wasn\\'t the idea of Buddy sleeping with somebody that\\nbothered me.  I mean I\\'d read about all sorts of people sleeping with\\neach other, and if it had been any other boy I would merely have asked\\nhim the most interesting details, and maybe gone out and slept with\\nsomebody myself just to even things up, and then thought no more about\\nit.\\n\\nWhat I couldn\\'t stand was Buddy\\'s pretending I was so sexy and he was\\nso pure, when all the time he\\'d been having an affair with that tarty\\nwaitress and must have felt like laughing in my face.\\n\\n\\'What does your mother think about this waitress?\\' I asked Buddy that\\nweek-end.\\n\\nBuddy was amazingly close to his mother.  He was always quoting what\\nshe said about the relationship between a man and a woman, and I knew\\nMrs Willard was a real fanatic about virginity for men and women both.\\nWhen I first went to her house for supper she gave me a queer, shrewd,\\nsearching look, and I knew she was trying to tell whether I was a\\nvirgin or not.\\n\\nJust as I thought, Buddy was embarrassed.  \\'Mother asked me about\\nGladys,\\' he admitted.\\n\\n\\'Well, what did you say?\\'\\n\\n\\'I said Gladys was free, white and twenty-one.\\'\\n\\nNow I knew Buddy would never talk to his mother as rudely as that for\\nmy sake.  He was always saying how his mother said, \\'What a man wants\\nis a mate and what a woman wants is infinite security,\\' and, \\'What a\\nman is is an arrow into the future and what a woman is is the place the\\narrow shoots off from,\\' until it made me tired.\\n\\nEvery time I tried to argue, Buddy would say his mother still got\\npleasure out of his father and wasn\\'t that wonderful for people their\\nage, it must mean she really knew what was what.\\n\\nWell, I had just decided to ditch Buddy Willard for once and for all,\\nnot because he\\'d slept with that waitress but because he didn\\'t have\\nthe honest guts to admit it straight off to everybody and face up to it\\nas part of his character, when the phone in the hall rang and somebody\\nsaid in a little knowing singsong, \\'It\\'s for you, Esther, it\\'s from\\nBoston.\\'\\n\\nI could tell right away something must be wrong, because Buddy was the\\nonly person I knew in Boston, and he never called me long distance\\nbecause it was so much more expensive than letters.  Once, when he had\\na message he wanted me to get almost immediately, he went all round his\\nentry at medical school asking if anybody was driving up to my college\\nthat week-end, and sure enough, somebody was, so he gave them a note\\nfor me and I got it the same day.  He didn\\'t even have to pay for a\\nstamp.\\n\\nIt was Buddy all right.  He told me that the annual fall chest X-ray\\nshowed he had caught TB and he was going off on a scholarship for\\nmedical students who caught TB to a TB place in the Adirondacks.  Then\\nhe said I hadn\\'t written since that last week-end and he hoped nothing\\nwas the matter between us, and would I please try to write him at least\\nonce a week and come to visit him at this TB place in my Christmas\\nvacation?\\n\\nI had never heard Buddy so upset.  He was very proud of his perfect\\nhealth and was always telling me it was psychosomatic when my sinuses\\nblocked up and I couldn\\'t breathe.  I thought this an odd attitude for\\na doctor to have and perhaps he should study to be a psychiatrist\\ninstead, but of course I never came right out and said so.\\n\\nI told Buddy how sorry I was about the TB and promised to write, but\\nwhen I hung up I didn\\'t feel one bit sorry.  I only felt a wonderful\\nrelief.\\n\\nI thought the TB might just be a punishment for living the kind of\\ndouble life Buddy lived and feeling so superior to people.  And I\\nthought how convenient it would be now I didn\\'t have to announce to\\neverybody at college I had broken off with Buddy and start the boring\\nbusiness of blind dates all over again.\\n\\nI simply told everyone that Buddy had TB and we were practically\\nengaged, and when I stayed in to study on Saturday nights they were\\nextremely kind to me because they thought I was so brave, working the\\nway I did just to hide a broken heart.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter Seven\\n\\nOf course, Constantin was much too short, but in his own way he was\\nhandsome, with light brown hair and dark blue eyes and a lively,\\nchallenging expression.  He could almost have been an American, he was\\nso tan and had such good teeth, but I could tell straight away that he\\nwasn\\'t.  He had what no American man I\\'ve ever met has had, and that\\'s\\nintuition.\\n\\nFrom the start Constantin guessed I wasn\\'t any protégée of Mrs\\nWillard\\'s.  I raised an eyebrow here and dropped a dry little laugh\\nthere, and pretty soon we were both openly raking Mrs Willard over the\\ncoals and I thought, \\'This Constantin won\\'t mind if I\\'m too tall and\\ndon\\'t know enough languages and haven\\'t been to Europe, he\\'ll see\\nthrough all that stuff to what I really am.\\'\\n\\nConstantin drove me to the UN in his old green convertible with\\ncracked, comfortable brown leather seats and the top down.  He told me\\nhis tan came from playing tennis, and when we were sitting there side\\nby side flying down the streets in the open sun he took my hand and\\nsqueezed it, and I felt happier than I had been since I was about nine\\nand running along the hot white beaches with my father the summer\\nbefore he died.\\n\\nAnd while Constantin and I sat in one of those hushed plush auditoriums\\nin the UN, next to a stern muscular Russian girl with no make-up who\\nwas a simultaneous interpreter like Constantin, I thought how strange\\nit had never occurred to me before that I was only purely happy until I\\nwas nine years old.\\n\\nAfter that--in spite of the Girl Scouts and the piano lessons and the\\nwater-colour lessons and the dancing lessons and the sailing camp, all\\nof which my mother scrimped to give me, and college, with crewing in\\nthe mist before breakfast and black-bottom pies and the little new\\nfirecrackers of ideas going off every day--I had never been really\\nhappy again.\\n\\nI stared through the Russian girl in her double-breasted grey suit,\\nrattling off idiom after idiom in her own unknowable tongue--which\\nConstantin said was the most difficult part, because the Russians\\ndidn\\'t have the same idioms as our idioms--and I wished with all my\\nheart I could crawl into her and spend the rest of my life barking out\\none idiom after another.  It mightn\\'t make me any happier, but it would\\nbe one more little pebble of efficiency among all the other pebbles.\\n\\nThen Constantin and the Russian girl interpreter and the whole bunch of\\nblack and white and yellow men arguing down there behind their labelled\\nmicrophones seemed to move off at a distance.  I saw their mouths going\\nup and down without a sound, as if they were sitting on the deck of a\\ndeparting ship, stranding me in the middle of a huge silence.\\n\\nI started adding up all the things I couldn\\'t do.\\n\\nI began with cooking.\\n\\nMy grandmother and my mother were such good cooks that I left\\neverything to them.  They were always trying to teach me one dish or\\nanother, but I would just look on and say, \\'Yes, yes, I see,\\' while the\\ninstructions slid through my head like water, and then I\\'d always spoil\\nwhat I did so nobody would ask me to do it again.\\n\\nI remember Jody, my best and only girl-friend at college in my freshman\\nyear, making me scrambled eggs at her house one morning.  They tasted\\nunusual, and when I asked her if she had put in anything extra, she\\nsaid cheese and garlic salt.  I asked who told her to do that, and she\\nsaid nobody, she just thought it up.  But then, she was practical and a\\nsociology major.\\n\\nI didn\\'t know shorthand either.\\n\\nThis meant I couldn\\'t get a good job after college.  My mother kept\\ntelling me nobody wanted a plain English major.  But an English major\\nwho knew shorthand was something else again.  Everybody would want her.\\nShe would be in demand among all the up-and-coming young men and she\\nwould transcribe letter after thrilling letter.\\n\\nThe trouble was, I hated the idea of serving men in any way.  I wanted\\nto dictate my own thrilling letters.  Besides, those little shorthand\\nsymbols in the book my mother showed me seemed just as bad as let _t_\\nequal time and let _s_ equal the total distance.\\n\\nMy list grew longer.\\n\\nI was a terrible dancer.  I couldn\\'t carry a tune.  I had no sense of\\nbalance, and when we had to walk down a narrow board with our hands out\\nand a book on our heads in gym class I always fell over.  I couldn\\'t\\nride a horse or ski, the two things I wanted to do most, because they\\ncost too much money.  I couldn\\'t speak German or read Hebrew or write\\nChinese.  I didn\\'t even know where most of the odd out-of-the-way\\ncountries the UN men in front of me represented fitted in on the map.\\n\\nFor the first time in my life, sitting there in the sound-proof heart\\nof the UN building between Constantin who could play tennis as well as\\nsimultaneously interpret and the Russian girl who knew so many idioms,\\nI felt dreadfully inadequate.  The trouble was, I had been inadequate\\nall along, I simply hadn\\'t thought about it.\\n\\nThe one thing I was good at was winning scholarships and prizes, and\\nthat era was coming to an end.\\n\\nI felt like a racehorse in a world without race-tracks or a champion\\ncollege footballer suddenly confronted by Wall Street and a business\\nsuit, his days of glory shrunk to a little gold cup on his mantel with\\na date engraved on it like the date on a tombstone.\\n\\nI saw my life branching out before me like the green fig-tree in the\\nstory.\\n\\nFrom the tip of every branch, like a fat purple fig, a wonderful future\\nbeckoned and winked.  One fig was a husband and a happy home and\\nchildren, and another fig was a famous poet and another fig was a\\nbrilliant professor, and another fig was Ee Gee, the amazing editor,\\nand another fig was Europe and Africa and South America, and another\\nfig was Constantin and Socrates and Attila and a pack of other lovers\\nwith queer names and off-beat professions, and another fig was an\\nOlympic lady crew champion, and beyond and above these figs were many\\nmore figs I couldn\\'t quite make out.\\n\\nI saw myself sitting in the crotch of this fig-tree, starving to death,\\njust because I couldn\\'t make up my mind which of the figs I would\\nchoose.  I wanted each and every one of them, but choosing one meant\\nlosing all the rest, and, as I sat there, unable to decide, the figs\\nbegan to wrinkle and go black, and, one by one, they plopped to the\\nground at my feet.\\n\\nConstantin\\'s restaurant smelt of herbs and spices and sour cream.  All\\nthe time I had been in New York I had never found such a restaurant.  I\\nonly found those Heavenly Hamburger places, where they serve giant\\nhamburgers and soup-of-the-day and four kinds of fancy cake at a very\\nclean counter facing a long glarey mirror.\\n\\nTo reach this restaurant we had to climb down seven dimly-lit steps\\ninto a sort of cellar.\\n\\nTravel posters plastered the smoke-dark walls, like so many picture\\nwindows overlooking Swiss lakes and Japanese mountains and African\\nvelds, and thick, dusty bottle-candles that seemed for centuries to\\nhave wept their coloured waxes red over blue over green in a fine,\\nthree-dimensional lace, cast a circle of light round each table where\\nthe faces floated, flushed and flamelike themselves.\\n\\nI don\\'t know what I ate, but I felt immensely better after the first\\nmouthful.  It occurred to me that my vision of the fig-tree and all the\\nfat figs that withered and fell to earth might well have arisen from\\nthe profound void of an empty stomach.\\n\\nConstantin kept refilling our glasses with a sweet Greek wine that\\ntasted of pine bark, and I found myself telling him how I was going to\\nlearn German and go to Europe and be a war correspondent like Maggie\\nHiggins.\\n\\nI felt so fine by the time we came to the yoghourt and strawberry jam\\nthat I decided I would let Constantin seduce me.\\n\\n\\nEver since Buddy Willard had told me about that waitress I had been\\nthinking I ought to go out and sleep with somebody myself.  Sleeping\\nwith Buddy wouldn\\'t count, though, because he would still be one person\\nahead of me, it would have to be with somebody else.\\n\\nThe only boy I ever actually discussed going to bed with was a bitter,\\nhawk-nosed Southerner from Yale, who came up to college one week-end\\nonly to find his date had eloped with a taxi-driver the day before.  As\\nthe girl had lived in my house and as I was the only one home that\\nparticular night, it was my job to cheer him up.\\n\\nAt the local coffee-shop, hunched in one of the secretive, high-backed\\nbooths with hundreds of peoples\\' names gouged into the wood, we drank\\ncup after cup of black coffee and talked frankly about sex.\\n\\nThis boy--his name was Eric--said he thought it disgusting the way all\\nthe girls at my college stood around on the porches under the porch\\nlights and in the bushes in plain view, necking madly before the one\\no\\'clock curfew, so everybody passing by could see them.  A million\\nyears of evolution, Eric said bitterly, and what are we?  Animals.\\n\\nThen Eric told me how he had slept with his first woman.\\n\\nHe went to a Southern prep school that specialized in building\\nall-round gentlemen, and by the time you graduated it was an unwritten\\nrule that you had to have known a woman.  Known in the Biblical sense,\\nEric said.\\n\\nSo one Saturday Eric and a few of his classmates took a bus into the\\nnearest city and visited a notorious whore house.  Eric\\'s whore hadn\\'t\\neven taken off her dress.  She was a fat, middle-aged woman with dyed\\nred hair and suspiciously thick lips and rat-coloured skin and she\\nwouldn\\'t turn off the light, so he had had her under a fly-spotted\\ntwenty-five watt bulb, and it was nothing like it was cracked up to be.\\nIt was boring as going to the toilet.\\n\\nI said maybe if you loved a woman it wouldn\\'t seem so boring, but Eric\\nsaid it would be spoiled by thinking this woman too was just an animal\\nlike the rest, so if he loved anybody he would never go to bed with\\nher.  He\\'d go to a whore if he had to and keep the woman he loved free\\nof all that dirty business.\\n\\nIt had crossed my mind at the time that Eric might be a good person to\\ngo to bed with, since he had already done it and, unlike the usual run\\nof boys, didn\\'t seem dirty-minded or silly when he talked about it.\\nBut then Eric wrote me a letter saying he thought he might really be\\nable to love me, I was so intelligent and cynical and yet had such a\\nkind face, surprisingly like his older sister\\'s; so I knew it was no\\nuse, I was the type he would never go to bed with, and wrote him I was\\nunfortunately about to marry a childhood sweetheart.\\n\\n\\nThe more I thought about it the better I liked the idea of being\\nseduced by a simultaneous interpreter in New York City.  Constantin\\nseemed mature and considerate in every way.  There were no people I\\nknew he would want to brag to about it, the way college boys bragged\\nabout sleeping with girls in the backs of cars to their room-mates or\\ntheir friends on the basketball team.  And there would be a pleasant\\nirony in sleeping with a man Mrs Willard had introduced me to, as if\\nshe were, in a roundabout way, to blame for it.\\n\\nWhen Constantin asked if I would like to come up to his apartment to\\nhear some balalaika records I smiled to myself.  My mother had always\\ntold me never under any circumstances to go with a man to a man\\'s rooms\\nafter an evening out, it could mean only the one thing.\\n\\n\\'I am very fond of balalaika music,\\' I said.\\n\\nConstantin\\'s room had a balcony, and the balcony overlooked the river,\\nand we could hear the hooing of the tugs down in the darkness.  I felt\\nmoved and tender and perfectly certain about what I was going to do.\\n\\nI knew I might have a baby, but that thought hung far and dim in the\\ndistance and didn\\'t trouble me at all.  There was no one hundred per\\ncent sure way not to have a baby, it said in an article my mother cut\\nout of the _Reader\\'s Digest_ and mailed to me at college.  This article\\nwas written by a married woman lawyer with children and called \\'In\\nDefence of Chastity\\'.\\n\\nIt gave all the reasons a girl shouldn\\'t sleep with anybody but her\\nhusband and then only after they were married.\\n\\nThe main point of the article was that a man\\'s world is different from\\na woman\\'s world and a man\\'s emotions are different from a woman\\'s\\nemotions and only marriage can bring the two worlds and the two\\ndifferent sets of emotions together properly.  My mother said this was\\nsomething a girl didn\\'t know about till it was too late, so she had to\\ntake the advice of people who were already experts, like a married\\nwoman.\\n\\nThis woman lawyer said the best men wanted to be pure for their wives,\\nand even if they weren\\'t pure, they wanted to be the ones to teach\\ntheir wives about sex.  Of course they would try to persuade a girl to\\nhave sex and say they would marry her later, but as soon as she gave\\nin, they would lose all respect for her and start saying that if she\\ndid that with them she would do that with other men and they would end\\nup by making her life miserable.\\n\\nThe woman finished her article by saying better be safe than sorry and\\nbesides, there was no sure way of not getting stuck with a baby and\\nthen you\\'d really be in a pickle.\\n\\nNow the one thing this article didn\\'t seem to me to consider was how a\\ngirl felt.\\n\\nIt might be nice to be pure and then to marry a pure man, but what if\\nhe suddenly confessed he wasn\\'t pure after we were married, the way\\nBuddy Willard had?  I couldn\\'t stand the idea of a woman having to have\\na single pure life and a man being able to have a double life, one pure\\nand one not.\\n\\nFinally I decided that if it was so difficult to find a red-blooded\\nintelligent man who was still pure by the time he was twenty-one I\\nmight as well forget about staying pure myself and marry somebody who\\nwasn\\'t pure either.  Then when he started to make my life miserable I\\ncould make his miserable as well.\\n\\nWhen I was nineteen, pureness was the great issue.\\n\\nInstead of the world being divided up into Catholics and Protestants or\\nRepublicans and Democrats or white men and black men or even men and\\nwomen, I saw the world divided into people who had slept with somebody\\nand people who hadn\\'t, and this seemed the only really significant\\ndifference between one person and another.\\n\\nI thought a spectacular change would come over me the day I crossed the\\nboundary line.\\n\\nI thought it would be the way I\\'d feel if I ever visited Europe.  I\\'d\\ncome home, and if I looked closely into the mirror I\\'d be able to make\\nout a little white Alp at the back of my eye.  Now I thought that if I\\nlooked into the mirror tomorrow I\\'d see a doll-size Constantin sitting\\nin my eye and smiling out at me.\\n\\nWell for about an hour we lounged on Constantin\\'s balcony in two\\nseparate sling-back chairs with the victrola playing and the balalaika\\nrecords stacked between us.  A faint milky light diffused from the\\nstreet lights or the half-moon or the cars or the stars, I couldn\\'t\\ntell what, but apart from holding my hand Constantin showed no desire\\nto seduce me whatsoever.\\n\\nI asked if he was engaged or had any special girl friend, thinking\\nmaybe that\\'s what was the matter, but he said no, he made a point of\\nkeeping clear of such attachments.\\n\\nAt last I felt a powerful drowsiness drifting through my veins from all\\nthe pine-bark wine I had drunk.\\n\\n\\'I think I\\'ll go in and lie down,\\' I said.\\n\\nI strolled casually into the bedroom and stooped over to nudge off my\\nshoes.  The clean bed bobbed before me like a safe boat.  I stretched\\nfull-length and shut my eyes.  Then I heard Constantin sigh and come in\\nfrom the balcony.  One by one his shoes clonked on to the floor, and he\\nlay down by my side.\\n\\nI looked at him secretly from under a fall of hair.\\n\\nHe was lying on his back, his hands under his head, staring at the\\nceiling.  The starched white sleeves of his shirt, rolled up to the\\nelbows, glimmered eerily in the half-dark and his tan skin seemed\\nalmost black.  I thought he must be the most beautiful man I\\'d ever\\nseen.\\n\\nI thought if only I had a keen, shapely bone-structure to my face or\\ncould discuss politics shrewdly or was a famous writer Constantin might\\nfind me interesting enough to sleep with.\\n\\nAnd then I wondered if as soon as he came to like me he would sink into\\nordinariness, and if as soon as he came to love me I would find fault\\nafter fault, the way I did with Buddy Willard and the boys before him.\\n\\nThe same thing happened over and over:\\n\\nI would catch sight of some flawless man off in the distance, but as\\nsoon as he moved closer I immediately saw he wouldn\\'t do at all.\\n\\nThat\\'s one of the reasons I never wanted to get married.  The last\\nthing I wanted was infinite security and to be the place an arrow\\nshoots off from.  I wanted change and excitement and to shoot off in\\nall directions myself, like the coloured arrows from a Fourth of July\\nrocket.\\n\\n\\nI woke to the sound of rain.\\n\\nIt was pitch dark.  After a while I deciphered the faint outlines of an\\nunfamiliar window.  Every so often a beam of light appeared out of thin\\nair, traversed the wall like a ghostly, exploratory finger, and slid\\noff into nothing again.\\n\\nThen I heard the sound of somebody breathing.\\n\\nAt first I thought it was only myself, and that I was lying in the dark\\nin my hotel room after being poisoned.  I held my breath, but the\\nbreathing kept on.\\n\\nA green eye glowed on the bed beside me.  It was divided into quarters\\nlike a compass.  I reached out slowly and closed my hand on it.  I\\nlifted it up.  With it came an arm, heavy as a dead man\\'s, but warm\\nwith sleep.\\n\\nConstantin\\'s watch said three o\\'clock.\\n\\nHe was lying in his shirt and trousers and stocking feet just as I had\\nleft him when I dropped asleep, and as my eyes grew used to the\\ndarkness I made out his pale eyelids and his straight nose and his\\ntolerant, shapely mouth, but they seemed insubstantial, as if drawn on\\nfog.  For a few minutes I leaned over, studying him.  I had never\\nfallen asleep beside a man before.\\n\\nI tried to imagine what it would be like if Constantin were my husband.\\n\\nIt would mean getting up at seven and cooking him eggs and bacon and\\ntoast and coffee and dawdling about in my nightgown and curlers after\\nhe\\'d left for work to wash up the dirty plates and make the bed, and\\nthen when he came home after a lively, fascinating day he\\'d expect a\\nbig dinner, and I\\'d spend the evening washing up even more dirty plates\\ntill I fell into bed, utterly exhausted.\\n\\nThis seemed a dreary and wasted life for a girl with fifteen years of\\nstraight A\\'s, but I knew that\\'s what marriage was like, because cook\\nand clean and wash was just what Buddy Willard\\'s mother did from\\nmorning till night, and she was the wife of a university professor and\\nhad been a private school teacher herself.\\n\\nOnce when I visited Buddy I found Mrs Willard braiding a rug out of\\nstrips of wool from Mr Willard\\'s old suits.  She\\'d spent weeks on that\\nrug, and I had admired the tweedy browns and greens and blues\\npatterning the braid, but after Mrs Willard was through, instead of\\nhanging the rug on the wall the way I would have done, she put it down\\nin place of her kitchen mat, and in a few days it was soiled and dull\\nand indistinguishable from any mat you could buy for under a dollar in\\nthe Five and Ten.\\n\\nAnd I knew that in spite of all the roses and kisses and restaurant\\ndinners a man showered on a woman before he married her, what he\\nsecretly wanted when the wedding service ended was for her to flatten\\nout underneath his feet like Mrs Willard\\'s kitchen mat.\\n\\nHadn\\'t my own mother told me that as soon as she and my father left\\nReno on their honeymoon--my father had been married before, so he\\nneeded a divorce--my father said to her, \\'Whew, that\\'s a relief, now we\\ncan stop pretending and be ourselves\\'?--and from that day on my mother\\nnever had a minute\\'s peace.\\n\\nI also remembered Buddy Willard saying in a sinister, knowing way that\\nafter I had children I would feel differently, I wouldn\\'t want to write\\npoems any more.  So I began to think maybe it was true that when you\\nwere married and had children it was like being brainwashed, and\\nafterwards you went about numb as a slave in some private, totalitarian\\nstate.\\n\\nAs I stared down at Constantin the way you stare down at a bright,\\nunattainable pebble at the bottom of a deep well, his eyelids lifted\\nand he looked through me, and his eyes were full of love.  I watched\\ndumbly as a little shutter of recognition clicked across the blur of\\ntenderness and the wide pupils went glossy and depthless as patent\\nleather.\\n\\nConstantin sat up, yawning.  \\'What time is it?\\'\\n\\n\\'Three,\\' I said in a flat voice.  \\'I better go home.  I have to be at\\nwork first thing in the morning.\\'\\n\\n\\'I\\'ll drive you.\\'\\n\\nAs we sat back to back on our separate sides of the bed fumbling with\\nour shoes in the horrid cheerful white light of the bed lamp, I sensed\\nConstantin turn round.  \\'Is your hair always like that?\\'\\n\\n\\'Like what?\\'\\n\\nHe didn\\'t answer but reached over and put his hand at the root of my\\nhair and ran his fingers out slowly to the tip ends like a comb.  A\\nlittle electric shock flared through me, and I sat quite still.  Ever\\nsince I was small I loved feeling somebody comb my hair.  It made me go\\nall sleepy and peaceful.\\n\\n\\'Ah, I know what it is,\\' Constantin said.  \\'You\\'ve just washed it.\\'\\n\\nAnd he bent to lace up his tennis shoes.\\n\\nAn hour later I lay in my hotel bed, listening to the rain.  It didn\\'t\\neven sound like rain, it sounded like a tap running.  The ache in the\\nmiddle of my left shin bone came to life, and I abandoned any hope of\\nsleep before seven, when my radio-alarm clock would rouse me with its\\nhearty renderings of Sousa.\\n\\nEvery time it rained the old leg-break seemed to remember itself, and\\nwhat it remembered was a dull hurt.\\n\\nThen I thought, \\'Buddy Willard made me break that leg.\\'\\n\\nThen I thought, \\'No, I broke it myself.  I broke it on purpose to pay\\nmyself back for being such a heel.\\'\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter Eight\\n\\nMr Willard drove me up to the Adirondacks.\\n\\nIt was the day after Christmas and a grey sky bellied over us, fat with\\nsnow.  I felt overstuffed and dull and disappointed, the way I always\\ndo the day after Christmas, as if whatever it was the pine boughs and\\nthe candles and the silver and gilt-ribboned presents and the birch-log\\nfires and the Christmas turkey and the carols at the piano promised\\nnever came to pass.\\n\\nAt Christmas I almost wished I was a Catholic.\\n\\nFirst Mr Willard drove and then I drove.  I don\\'t know what we talked\\nabout, but as the countryside, already deep under old falls of snow,\\nturned us a bleaker shoulder, and as the fir trees crowded down from\\nthe grey hills to the road edge, so darkly green they looked black, I\\ngrew gloomier and gloomier.\\n\\nI was tempted to tell Mr Willard to go ahead alone, I would hitch-hike\\nhome.\\n\\nBut one glance at Mr Willard\\'s face--the silver hair in its boyish\\ncrewcut, the clear blue eyes, the pink cheeks, all frosted like a sweet\\nwedding cake with the innocent, trusting expression--and I knew I\\ncouldn\\'t do it.  I\\'d have to see the visit through to the end.\\n\\nAt midday the greyness paled a bit, and we parked in an icy turn-off\\nand shared out the tunafish sandwiches and the oatmeal cookies and the\\napples and the thermos of black coffee Mrs Willard had packed for our\\nlunch.\\n\\nMr Willard eyed me kindly.  Then he cleared his throat and brushed a\\nfew last crumbs from his lap.  I could tell he was going to say\\nsomething serious, because he was very shy, and I\\'d heard him clear his\\nthroat in that same way before giving an important economics lecture.\\n\\n\\'Nelly and I have always wanted a daughter.\\'\\n\\nFor one crazy minute I thought Mr Willard was going to announce that\\nMrs Willard was pregnant and expecting a baby girl.  Then he said, \\'But\\nI don\\'t see how any daughter could be nicer than you.\\'\\n\\nMr Willard must have thought I was crying because I was so glad he\\nwanted to be a father to me.  \\'There, there,\\' he patted my shoulder and\\ncleared his throat once or twice.  \\'I think we understand each other.\\'\\n\\nThen he opened the car door on his side and strolled round to my side,\\nhis breath shaping tortuous smoke signals in the grey air.  I moved\\nover to the seat he had left and he started the car and we drove on.\\n\\nI\\'m not sure what I expected of Buddy\\'s sanatorium.\\n\\nI think I expected a kind of wooden chalet perched up on top of a small\\nmountain, with rosy-cheeked young men and women, all very attractive\\nbut with hectic glittering eyes, lying covered with thick blankets on\\noutdoor balconies.\\n\\n\\'TB is like living with a bomb in your lung,\\' Buddy had written to me\\nat college.  \\'You just lie around very quietly hoping it won\\'t go off.\\'\\n\\nI found it hard to imagine Buddy lying quietly.  His whole philosophy\\nof life was to be up and doing every second.  Even when we went to the\\nbeach in the summer he never lay down to drowse in the sun the way I\\ndid.  He ran back and forth or played ball or did a little series of\\nrapid push-ups to use the time.\\n\\nMr Willard and I waited in the reception room for the end of the\\nafternoon rest cure.\\n\\nThe colour scheme of the whole sanatorium seemed to be based on liver.\\nDark, glowering woodwork, burnt-brown leather chairs, walls that might\\nonce have been white but had succumbed under a spreading malady of\\nmould or damp.  A mottled brown linoleum sealed off the floor.\\n\\nOn a low coffee-table, with circular and semi-circular stains bitten\\ninto the dark veneer, lay a few wilted numbers of _Time_ and _Life_.  I\\nflipped to the middle of the nearest magazine.  The face of Eisenhower\\nbeamed up at me, bald and blank as the face of a foetus in a bottle.\\n\\nAfter a while I became aware of a sly, leaking noise.  For a minute I\\nthought the walls had begun to discharge the moisture that must\\nsaturate them, but then I saw the noise came from a small fountain in\\none corner of the room.\\n\\nThe fountain spurted a few inches into the air from a rough length of\\npipe, threw up its hands, collapsed and drowned its ragged dribble in a\\nstone basin of yellowing water.  The basin was paved with the white\\nhexagonal tiles one finds in public lavatories.\\n\\nA buzzer sounded.  Doors opened and shut in the distance.  Then Buddy\\ncame in.\\n\\n\\'Hello, Dad.\\'\\n\\nBuddy hugged his father, and promptly, with a dreadful brightness, came\\nover to me and held out his hand.  I shook it.  It felt moist and fat.\\n\\nMr Willard and I sat together on a leather couch.  Buddy perched\\nopposite us on the edge of a slippery armchair.  He kept smiling, as if\\nthe corners of his mouth were strung up on invisible wire.\\n\\nThe last thing I expected was for Buddy to be fat.  All the time I\\nthought of him at the sanatorium I saw shadows carving themselves under\\nhis cheekbones and his eyes burning out of almost fleshless sockets.\\n\\nBut everything concave about Buddy had suddenly turned convex.  A pot\\nbelly swelled under the tight white nylon shirt and his cheeks were\\nround and ruddy as marzipan fruit.  Even his laugh sounded plump.\\n\\nBuddy\\'s eyes met mine.  \\'It\\'s the eating,\\' he said.  \\'They stuff us day\\nafter day and then just make us lie around.  But I\\'m allowed out on\\nwalk-hours now, so don\\'t worry, I\\'ll thin down in a couple of weeks.\\'\\nHe jumped up, smiling like a glad host.  \\'Would you like to see my\\nroom?\\'\\n\\nI followed Buddy, and Mr Willard followed me, through a pair of\\nswinging doors set with panes of frosted glass down a dim,\\nliver-coloured corridor smelling of floor wax and lysol and another\\nvaguer odour, like bruised gardenias.\\n\\nBuddy threw open a brown door, and we filed into the narrow room.\\n\\nA lumpy bed, shrouded by a thin white spread, pencil-striped with blue,\\ntook up most of the space.  Next to it stood a bed table with a pitcher\\nand a water glass and the silver twig of a thermometer poking up from a\\njar of pink disinfectant.  A second table, covered with books and\\npapers and off-kilter clay pots--baked and painted, but not\\nglazed--squeezed itself between the bed foot and the closet door.\\n\\n\\'Well,\\' Mr Willard breathed, \\'it looks comfortable enough.\\'\\n\\nBuddy laughed.\\n\\n\\'What are these?\\'  I picked up a clay ashtray in the shape of a\\nlilypad, with the veinings carefully drawn in yellow on a murky green\\nground.  Buddy didn\\'t smoke.\\n\\n\\'That\\'s an ashtray,\\' Buddy said.  \\'It\\'s for you.\\'\\n\\nI put the tray down.  \\'I don\\'t smoke.\\'\\n\\n\\'I know,\\' Buddy said.  \\'I thought you might like it, though.\\'\\n\\n\\'Well,\\' Mr Willard rubbed one papery lip against another.  \\'I guess\\nI\\'ll be getting on.  I guess I\\'ll be leaving you two young people...\\'\\n\\n\\'Fine, Dad.  You be getting on.\\'\\n\\nI was surprised.  I had thought Mr Willard was going to stay the night\\nbefore driving me back the next day.\\n\\n\\'Shall I come too?\\'\\n\\n\\'No, no.\\'  Mr Willard peeled a few bills from his wallet and handed\\nthem to Buddy.  \\'See that Esther gets a comfortable seat on the train.\\nShe\\'ll stay a day or so, maybe.\\'\\n\\nBuddy escorted his father to the door.\\n\\nI felt Mr Willard had deserted me.  I thought he must have planned it\\nall along, but Buddy said No, his father simply couldn\\'t stand the\\nsight of sickness and especially his own son\\'s sickness, because he\\nthought all sickness was sickness of the will.  Mr Willard had never\\nbeen sick a day in his life.\\n\\nI sat down on Buddy\\'s bed.  There simply wasn\\'t anywhere else to sit.\\n\\nBuddy rummaged among his papers in a businesslike way.  Then he handed\\nme a thin, grey magazine.  \\'Turn to page eleven.\\'\\n\\nThe magazine was printed somewhere in Maine and full of stencilled\\npoems and descriptive paragraphs separated from each other by\\nasterisks.  On page eleven I found a poem titled \\'Florida Dawn\\'.  I\\nskipped down through image after image about water-melon lights and\\nturtle-green palms and shells fluted like bits of Greek architecture.\\n\\n\\'Not bad.\\'  I thought it was dreadful.\\n\\n\\'Who wrote it?\\' Buddy asked with an odd, pigeony smile.\\n\\nMy eye dropped to the name on the lower right-hand corner of the page.\\nB. S. Willard.\\n\\n\\'I don\\'t know.\\'  Then I said, \\'Of course I know, Buddy.  You wrote it.\\'\\n\\nBuddy edged over to me.\\n\\nI edged back.  I had very little knowledge about TB, but it seemed to\\nme an extremely sinister disease, the way it went on so invisibly.  I\\nthought Buddy might well be sitting in his own little murderous aura of\\nTB germs.\\n\\n\\'Don\\'t worry,\\' Buddy laughed.  \\'I\\'m not positive.\\'\\n\\n\\'Positive?\\'\\n\\n\\'You won\\'t catch anything.\\'\\n\\nBuddy stopped for a breath, the way you do in the middle of climbing\\nsomething very steep.\\n\\n\\'I want to ask you a question.\\'  He had a disquieting new habit of\\nboring into my eyes with his look as if actually bent on piercing my\\nhead, the better to analyse what went on inside it.\\n\\n\\'I\\'d thought of asking it by letter.\\'\\n\\nI had a fleeting vision of a pale blue envelope with a Yale crest on\\nthe back flap.\\n\\n\\'But then I decided it would be better if I waited until you came up,\\nso I could ask you in person.\\'  He paused.  \\'Well, don\\'t you want to\\nknow what it is?\\'\\n\\n\\'What?\\' I said in a small, unpromising voice.\\n\\nBuddy sat down beside me.  He put his arm around my waist and brushed\\nthe hair from my ear.  I didn\\'t move.  Then I heard him whisper, \\'How\\nwould you like to be Mrs Buddy Willard?\\'\\n\\nI had an awful impulse to laugh.\\n\\nI thought how that question would have bowled me over at any time in my\\nfive-or six-year period of adoring Buddy Willard from a distance.\\n\\nBuddy saw me hesitate.\\n\\n\\'Oh, I\\'m in no shape now, I know,\\' he said quickly.  I\\'m still on\\nP.A.S. and I may yet lose a rib or two, but I\\'ll be back at med school\\nby next fall.  A year from this spring at the latest...\\'\\n\\n\\'I think I should tell you something, Buddy.\\'\\n\\n\\'I know,\\' Buddy said stiffly.  \\'You\\'ve met someone.\\'\\n\\n\\'No, it\\'s not that.\\'\\n\\n\\'What is it, then?\\'\\n\\n\\'I\\'m never going to get married.\\'\\n\\n\\'You\\'re crazy.\\'  Buddy brightened.  \\'You\\'ll change your mind.\\'\\n\\n\\'No.  My mind\\'s made up.\\'\\n\\nBut Buddy just went on looking cheerful.\\n\\n\\'Remember,\\' I said, \\'that time you hitch-hiked back to college with me\\nafter Skit Night?\\'\\n\\n\\'I remember.\\'\\n\\n\\'Remember how you asked me where would I like to live best, the country\\nor the city?\\'\\n\\n\\'And you said...\\'\\n\\n\\'And I said I wanted to live in the country and in the city both?\\'\\n\\nBuddy nodded.\\n\\n\\'And you,\\' I continued with sudden force, \\'laughed and said I had the\\nperfect set-up of a true neurotic and that that question came from some\\nquestionnaire you\\'d had in psychology class that week?\\'\\n\\nBuddy\\'s smile dimmed.\\n\\n\\'Well, you were right.  I _am_ neurotic.  I could never settle down in\\neither the country _or_ the city.\\'\\n\\n\\'You could live between them,\\' Buddy suggested helpfully.  \\'Then you\\ncould go to the city sometimes and to the country sometimes.\\'\\n\\n\\'Well, what\\'s so neurotic about that?\\'\\n\\nBuddy didn\\'t answer.\\n\\n\\'Well?\\' I rapped out, thinking, \\'You can\\'t coddle these sick people,\\nit\\'s the worst thing for them, it\\'ll spoil them to bits.\\'\\n\\n\\'Nothing,\\' Buddy said in a pale, still voice.\\n\\n\\'Neurotic, ha!\\'  I let out a scornful laugh.  \\'If neurotic is wanting\\ntwo mutually exclusive things at one and the same time, then I\\'m\\nneurotic as hell.  I\\'ll be flying back and forth between one mutually\\nexclusive thing and another for the rest of my days.\\'\\n\\nBuddy put his hand on mine.\\n\\n\\'Let me fly with you.\\'\\n\\n\\nI stood at the top of the ski slope on Mount Pisgah, looking down.  I\\nhad no business to be up there.  I had never skied before in my life.\\nStill, I thought I would enjoy the view while I had the chance.\\n\\nAt my left, the rope tow deposited skier after skier on the snowy\\nsummit which, packed by much crossing and re-crossing and slightly\\nmelted in the noon sun, had hardened to the consistency and polish of\\nglass.  The cold air punished my lungs and sinuses to a visionary\\nclearness.\\n\\nOn every side of me the red and blue and white jacketed skiers tore\\naway down the blinding slope like fugitive bits of an American flag.\\nFrom the foot of the ski run, the imitation log cabin lodge piped its\\npopular songs into the overhang of silence.\\n\\n  _Gazing down on the Jungfrau\\n  From our chalet for two..._\\n\\n\\nThe lilt and boom threaded by me like an invisible rivulet in a desert\\nof snow.  One careless, superb gesture, and I would be hurled into\\nmotion down the slope towards the small khaki spot in the sidelines,\\namong the spectators, which was Buddy Willard.\\n\\nAll morning Buddy had been teaching me how to ski.\\n\\nFirst, Buddy borrowed skis and ski poles from a friend of his in the\\nvillage, and ski boots from a doctor\\'s wife whose feet were only one\\nsize larger than my own, and a red ski jacket from a student nurse.\\nHis persistence in the face of mulishness was astounding.\\n\\nThen I remembered that at medical school Buddy had won a prize for\\npersuading the most relatives of dead people to have their dead ones\\ncut up whether they needed it or not, in the interests of science.  I\\nforget what the prize was, but I could just see Buddy in his white coat\\nwith his stethoscope sticking out of a side pocket like part of his\\nanatomy, smiling and bowing and talking those numb, dumb relatives into\\nsigning the post-mortem papers.\\n\\nNext, Buddy borrowed a car from his own doctor, who\\'d had TB himself\\nand was very understanding, and we drove off as the buzzer for\\nwalk-hour rasped along the sunless sanatorium corridors.\\n\\nBuddy had never skied before either, but he said that the elementary\\nprinciples were quite simple, and as he\\'d often watched the ski\\ninstructors and their pupils he could teach me all I\\'d need to know.\\n\\nFor the first half-hour I obediently herring-boned up a small slope,\\npushed off with my poles and coasted straight down.  Buddy seemed\\npleased with my progress.\\n\\n\\'That\\'s fine, Esther,\\' he observed, as I negotiated my slope for the\\ntwentieth time.  \\'Now let\\'s try you on the rope tow.\\'\\n\\nI stepped in my tracks, flushed and panting.\\n\\n\\'But Buddy, I don\\'t know how to zigzag yet.  All those people coming\\ndown from the top know how to zigzag.\\'\\n\\n\\'Oh, you need only go half-way.  Then you won\\'t gain very much\\nmomentum.\\'\\n\\nAnd Buddy accompanied me to the rope tow and showed me how to let the\\nrope run through my hands, and then told me to close my fingers round\\nit and go up.\\n\\nIt never occurred to me to say no.\\n\\nI wrapped my fingers around the rough, bruising snake of a rope that\\nslithered through them, and went up.\\n\\nBut the rope dragged me, wobbling and balancing, so rapidly I couldn\\'t\\nhope to dissociate myself from it half-way.  There was a skier in front\\nof me and a skier behind me, and I\\'d have been knocked over and stuck\\nfull of skis and poles the minute I let go, and I didn\\'t want to make\\ntrouble, so I hung quietly on.\\n\\nAt the top, though, I had second thoughts.\\n\\nBuddy singled me out, hesitating there in the red jacket.  His arms\\nchopped the air like khaki windmills.  Then I saw he was signalling me\\nto come down a path that had opened in the middle of the weaving\\nskiers.  But as I poised, uneasy, with a dry throat, the smooth white\\npath from my feet to his feet grew blurred.\\n\\nA skier crossed it from the left, another crossed it from the right,\\nand Buddy\\'s arms went on waving feebly as antennae from the other side\\nof a field swarming with tiny moving animalcules like germs, or bent,\\nbright exclamation marks.\\n\\nI looked up from that churning amphitheatre to the view beyond it.\\n\\nThe great, grey eye of the sky looked back at me, its mist-shrouded sun\\nfocusing all the white and silent distances that poured from every\\npoint of the compass, hill after pale hill, to stall at my feet.\\n\\nThe interior voice nagging me not to be a fool--to save my skin and\\ntake off my skis and walk down, camouflaged by the scrub pines\\nbordering the slope--fled like a disconsolate mosquito.  The thought\\nthat I might kill myself formed in my mind coolly as a tree or a flower.\\n\\nI measured the distance to Buddy with my eye.\\n\\nHis arms were folded, now, and he seemed of a piece with the split-rail\\nfence behind him--numb, brown and inconsequential.\\n\\nEdging to the rim of the hilltop, I dug the spikes of my poles into the\\nsnow and pushed myself into a flight I knew I couldn\\'t stop by skill or\\nany belated access of will.\\n\\nI aimed straight down.\\n\\nA keen wind that had been hiding itself struck me full in the mouth and\\nraked the hair back horizontal on my head.  I was descending, but the\\nwhite sun rose no higher.  It hung over the suspended waves of the\\nhills, an insentient pivot without which the world would not exist.\\n\\nA small, answering point in my own body flew towards it.  I felt my\\nlungs inflate with the inrush of scenery--air, mountains, trees,\\npeople.  I thought, \\'This is what it is to be happy.\\'\\n\\nI plummeted down past the zigzaggers, the students, the experts,\\nthrough year after year of doubleness and smiles and compromise, into\\nmy own past.\\n\\nPeople and trees receded on either hand like the dark sides of a tunnel\\nas I hurtled on to the still, bright point at the end of it, the pebble\\nat the bottom of the well, the white sweet baby cradled in its mother\\'s\\nbelly.\\n\\nMy teeth crunched a gravelly mouthful.  Ice water seeped down my throat.\\n\\nBuddy\\'s face hung over me, near and huge, like a distracted planet.\\nOther faces showed themselves up in back of his.  Behind them, black\\ndots swarmed on a plane of whiteness.  Piece by piece, as at the\\nstrokes of a dull godmother\\'s wand, the old world sprang back into\\nposition.\\n\\n\\'You were doing fine,\\' a familiar voice informed my ear, \\'until that\\nman stepped into your path.\\'\\n\\nPeople were unfastening my bindings and collecting my ski poles from\\nwhere they poked skyward, askew, in their separate snowbanks.  The\\nlodge fence propped itself at my back.\\n\\nBuddy bent to pull off my boots and the several pairs of white wool\\nsocks that padded them.  His plump hand shut on my left foot, then\\ninched up my ankle, closing and probing, as if feeling for a concealed\\nweapon.\\n\\nA dispassionate white sun shone at the summit of the sky.  I wanted to\\nhone myself on it till I grew saintly and thin and essential as the\\nblade of a knife.\\n\\n\\'I\\'m going up,\\' I said.  \\'I\\'m going to do it again.\\'\\n\\n\\'No, you\\'re not.\\'\\n\\nA queer, satisfied expression came over Buddy\\'s face.\\n\\n\\'No, you\\'re not,\\' he repeated with a final smile.  \\'Your leg\\'s broken\\nin two places.  You\\'ll be stuck in a cast for months.\\'\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter Nine\\n\\n\\'I\\'m so glad they\\'re going to die.\\'\\n\\nHilda arched her cat-limbs in a yawn, buried her head in her arms on\\nthe conference table and went back to sleep.  A wisp of bilious green\\nstraw perched on her brow like a tropical bird.\\n\\nBile green.  They were promoting it for fall, only Hilda, as usual, was\\nhalf a year ahead of time.  Bile green with black, bile green with\\nwhite, bile green with nile green, its kissing cousin.\\n\\nFashion blurbs, silver and full of nothing, sent up their fishy bubbles\\nin my brain.  They surfaced with a hollow pop.\\n\\n_I\\'m so glad they\\'re going to die_.\\n\\nI cursed the luck that had timed my arrival in the hotel cafeteria to\\ncoincide with Hilda\\'s.  After a late night I felt too dull to think up\\nthe excuse that would take me back to my room for the glove, the\\nhandkerchief, the umbrella, the notebook I forgot.  My penalty was the\\nlong, dead walk from the frosted glass doors of the Amazon to the\\nstrawberry-marble slab of our entry on Madison Avenue.\\n\\nHilda moved like a mannequin the whole way.\\n\\n\\'That\\'s a lovely hat, did you make it?\\'\\n\\nI half-expected Hilda to turn on me and say, \\'You sound sick\\', but she\\nonly extended and then retracted her swanny neck.\\n\\n\\'Yes.\\'\\n\\nThe night before I\\'d seen a play where the heroine was possessed by a\\ndybbuk, and when the dybbuk spoke from her mouth its voice sounded so\\ncavernous and deep you couldn\\'t tell whether it was a man or a woman.\\nWell Hilda\\'s voice sounded just like the voice of that dybbuk.\\n\\nShe stared at her reflection in the glossed shop windows as if to make\\nsure, moment by moment, that she continued to exist.  The silence\\nbetween us was so profound I thought part of it must be my fault.\\n\\nSo I said, \\'Isn\\'t it awful about the Rosenbergs?\\'\\n\\nThe Rosenbergs were to be electrocuted late that night.\\n\\n\\'Yes!\\' Hilda said, and at last I felt I had touched a human string in\\nthe cat\\'s cradle of her heart.  It was only as the two of us waited for\\nthe others in the tomb-like morning gloom of the conference room that\\nHilda amplified that Yes of hers.\\n\\n\\'It\\'s awful such people should be alive.\\'\\n\\nShe yawned then, and her pale orange mouth opened on a large darkness.\\nFascinated, I stared at the blind cave behind her face until the two\\nlips met and moved and the dybbuk spoke out of its hiding place, \\'I\\'m\\nso glad they\\'re going to die.\\'\\n\\n\\n\\'Come on, give us a smile.\\'\\n\\nI sat on the pink velvet love-seat in Jay Cee\\'s office, holding a paper\\nrose and facing the magazine photographer.  I was the last of the\\ntwelve to have my picture taken.  I had tried concealing myself in the\\npowder-room, but it didn\\'t work.  Betsy had spied my feet under the\\ndoors.\\n\\nI didn\\'t want my picture taken because I was going to cry.  I didn\\'t\\nknow why I was going to cry, but I knew that if anybody spoke to me or\\nlooked at me too closely the tears would fly out of my eyes and the\\nsobs would fly out of my throat and I\\'d cry for a week.  I could feel\\nthe tears brimming and sloshing in me like water in a glass that is\\nunsteady and too full.\\n\\nThis was the last round of photographs before the magazine went to\\npress and we returned to Tulsa or Biloxi or Teaneck or Coos Bay or\\nwherever we\\'d come from, and we were supposed to be photographed with\\nprops to show what we wanted to be.\\n\\nBetsy held an ear of corn to show she wanted to be a farmer\\'s wife, and\\nHilda held the bald, faceless head of a hatmaker\\'s dummy to show she\\nwanted to design hats, and Doreen held a gold-embroidered sari to show\\nshe wanted to be a social worker in India (she didn\\'t really, she told\\nme, she only wanted to get her hands on a sari).\\n\\nWhen they asked me what I wanted to be I said I didn\\'t know.\\n\\n\\'Oh, sure you know,\\' the photographer said.\\n\\n\\'She wants,\\' said Jay Cee wittily, \\'to be everything.\\'\\n\\nI said I wanted to be a poet.\\n\\nThen they scouted about for something for me to hold.\\n\\nJay Cee suggested a book of poems, but the photographer said no, that\\nwas too obvious.  It should be something that showed what inspired the\\npoems.  Finally Jay Cee unclipped the single, long-stemmed paper rose\\nfrom her latest hat.\\n\\nThe photographer fiddled with his hot white lights.  \\'Show us how happy\\nit makes you to write a poem.\\'\\n\\nI stared through the frieze of rubber plant leaves in Jay Cee\\'s window\\nto the blue sky beyond.  A few stagey cloud puffs were travelling from\\nright to left.  I fixed my eyes on the largest cloud, as if, when it\\npassed out of sight, I might have the good luck to pass with it.\\n\\nI felt it was very important to keep the line of my mouth level.\\n\\n\\'Give us a smile.\\'\\n\\nAt last, obediently, like the mouth of a ventriloquist\\'s dummy, my own\\nmouth started to quirk up.\\n\\n\\'Hey,\\' the photographer protested, with sudden foreboding, \\'you look\\nlike you\\'re going to cry.\\'\\n\\nI couldn\\'t stop.\\n\\nI buried my face in the pink velvet façade of Jay Cee\\'s love-seat and\\nwith immense relief the salt tears and miserable noises that had been\\nprowling around in me all morning burst out into the room.\\n\\nWhen I lifted my head, the photographer had vanished.  Jay Cee had\\nvanished as well.  I felt limp and betrayed, like the skin shed by a\\nterrible animal.  It was a relief to be free of the animal, but it\\nseemed to have taken my spirit with it, and everything else it could\\nlay its paws on.\\n\\nI fumbled in my pocketbook for the gilt compact with the mascara and\\nthe mascara brush and the eyeshadow and the three lipsticks and the\\nside mirror.  The face that peered back at me seemed to be peering from\\nthe grating of a prison cell after a prolonged beating.  It looked\\nbruised and puffy and all the wrong colours.  It was a face that needed\\nsoap and water and Christian tolerance.\\n\\nI started to paint it with small heart.\\n\\nJay Cee breezed back after a decent interval with an armful of\\nmanuscripts.\\n\\n\\'These\\'ll amuse you,\\' she said.  \\'Have a good read.\\'\\n\\nEvery morning a snowy avalanche of manuscripts swelled the dust-grey\\npiles in the office of the Fiction Editor.  Secretly, in studies and\\nattics and schoolrooms all over America, people must be writing.  Say\\nsomeone or other finished a manuscript every minute; in five minutes\\nthat would be five manuscripts stacked on the Fiction Editor\\'s desk.\\nWithin the hour there would be sixty, crowding each other on to the\\nfloor.  And in a year...\\n\\nI smiled, seeing a pristine, imaginary manuscript floating in mid-air,\\nwith Esther Greenwood typed in the upper-right hand corner.  After my\\nmonth on the magazine I\\'d applied for a summer school course with a\\nfamous writer where you sent in the manuscript of a story and he read\\nit and said whether you were good enough to be admitted into his class.\\n\\nOf course, it was a very small class, and I had sent in my story a long\\ntime ago and hadn\\'t heard from the writer yet, but I was sure I\\'d find\\nthe letter of acceptance waiting on the mail table at home.\\n\\nI decided I\\'d surprise Jay Cee and send in a couple of the stories I\\nwrote in this class under a pseudonym.  Then one day the Fiction Editor\\nwould come in to Jay Cee personally and plop the stories down on her\\ndesk and say, \\'Here\\'s something a cut above the usual,\\' and Jay Cee\\nwould agree and accept them and ask the author to lunch and it would be\\nme.\\n\\n\\n\\'Honestly,\\' Doreen said, \\'this one\\'ll be different.\\'\\n\\n\\'Tell me about him,\\' I said stonily.\\n\\n\\'He\\'s from Peru.\\'\\n\\n\\'They\\'re squat,\\' I said.  \\'They\\'re ugly as Aztecs.\\'\\n\\n\\'No, no, no, sweetie, I\\'ve already met him.\\'\\n\\nWe were sitting on my bed in a mess of dirty cotton dresses and\\nladdered nylons and grey underwear, and for ten minutes Doreen had been\\ntrying to persuade me to go to a country club dance with a friend of\\nsomebody Lenny knew which, she insisted, was a very different thing\\nfrom a friend of Lenny\\'s, but as I was catching the eight o\\'clock train\\nhome the next morning I felt I should make some attempt to pack.\\n\\nI also had a dim idea that if I walked the streets of New York by\\nmyself all night something of the city\\'s mystery and magnificence might\\nrub off on to me at last.\\n\\nBut I gave it up.\\n\\nIt was becoming more and more difficult for me to decide to do anything\\nin those last days.  And when I eventually did decide to do something,\\nsuch as packing a suitcase, I only dragged all my grubby, expensive\\nclothes out of the bureau and the closet and spread them on the chairs\\nand the bed and the floor and then sat and stared at them, utterly\\nperplexed.  They seemed to have a separate, mulish identity of their\\nown that refused to be washed and folded and stowed.\\n\\n\\'It\\'s these clothes,\\' I told Doreen.  \\'I just can\\'t face these clothes\\nwhen I come back.\\'\\n\\n\\'That\\'s easy.\\'\\n\\nAnd in her beautiful, one-track way, Doreen started to snatch up slips\\nand stockings and the elaborate strapless bra, full of steel springs--a\\nfree gift from the Primrose Corset Company, which I\\'d never had the\\ncourage to wear--and finally, one by one, the sad array of queerly-cut\\nforty dollar dresses...\\n\\n\\'Hey, leave that one out.  I\\'m wearing it.\\'\\n\\nDoreen extricated a black scrap from her bundle and dropped it in my\\nlap.  Then, snowballing the rest of the clothes into one soft,\\nconglomerate mass, she stuffed them out of sight under the bed.\\n\\n\\nDoreen knocked on the green door with the gold knob.\\n\\nScuffling and a man\\'s laugh, cut short, sounded from inside.  Then a\\ntall boy in shirtsleeves and a blond crewcut inched the door open and\\npeered out.\\n\\n\\'Baby!\\' he roared.\\n\\nDoreen disappeared in his arms.  I thought it must be the person Lenny\\nknew.\\n\\nI stood quietly in the doorway in my black sheath and my black stole\\nwith the fringe, yellower than ever, but expecting less.  \\'I am an\\nobserver,\\' I told myself, as I watched Doreen being handed into the\\nroom by the blond boy to another man, who was also tall, but dark, with\\nslightly longer hair.  This man was wearing an immaculate white suit, a\\npale blue shirt and a yellow satin tie with a bright stickpin.\\n\\nI couldn\\'t take my eyes off that stickpin.\\n\\nA great white light seemed to shoot out of it, illumining the room.\\nThen the light withdrew into itself, leaving a dewdrop on a field of\\ngold.\\n\\nI put one foot in front of the other.\\n\\n\\'That\\'s a diamond,\\' somebody said, and a lot of people burst out\\nlaughing.\\n\\nMy nail tapped a glassy facet.\\n\\n\\'Her first diamond.\\'\\n\\n\\'Give it to her, Marco.\\'\\n\\nMarco bowed and deposited the stickpin in my palm.\\n\\nIt dazzled and danced with light like a heavenly ice-cube.  I slipped\\nit quickly into my imitation jet bead evening bag and looked round.\\nThe faces were empty as plates, and nobody seemed to be breathing.\\n\\n\\'Fortunately,\\' a dry, hard hand encircled my upper arm, \\'I am escorting\\nthe lady for the rest of the evening.  Perhaps,\\' the spark in Marco\\'s\\neyes extinguished, and they went black, \\'I shall perform some small\\nservice...\\'\\n\\nSomebody laughed.\\n\\n\\'... worthy of a diamond.\\'\\n\\nThe hand round my arm tightened.\\n\\n\\'Ouch!\\'\\n\\nMarco removed his hand.  I looked down at my arm.  A thumb-print\\npurpled into view.  Marco watched me.  Then he pointed to the underside\\nof my arm.  \\'Look there.\\'\\n\\nI looked, and saw four, faint matching prints.\\n\\n\\'You see, I am quite serious.\\'\\n\\nMarco\\'s small, flickering smile reminded me of a snake I\\'d teased in\\nthe Bronx Zoo.  When I tapped my finger on the stout cage glass the\\nsnake had opened its clockwork jaws and seemed to smile.  Then it\\nstruck and struck and struck at the invisible pane till I moved off.\\n\\nI had never met a woman-hater before.\\n\\nI could tell Marco was a woman-hater, because in spite of all the\\nmodels and TV starlets in the room that night he paid attention to\\nnobody but me.  Not out of kindness or even curiosity, but because I\\'d\\nhappened to be dealt to him, like a playing card in a pack of identical\\ncards.\\n\\nA man in the country club band stepped up to the mike and started\\nshaking those seedpod rattles that mean South American music.\\n\\nMarco reached for my hand, but I hung on to my fourth daiquiri and\\nstayed put.  I\\'d never had a daiquiri before.  The reason I had a\\ndaiquiri was because Marco ordered it for me, and I felt so grateful he\\nhadn\\'t asked what sort of drink I wanted that I didn\\'t say a word, I\\njust drank one daiquiri after another.\\n\\nMarco looked at me.\\n\\n\\'No,\\' I said.\\n\\n\\'What do you mean, no?\\'\\n\\n\\'I can\\'t dance to that kind of music.\\'\\n\\n\\'Don\\'t be stupid.\\'\\n\\n\\'I want to sit here and finish my drink.\\'\\n\\nMarco bent towards me with a tight smile, and in one swoop my drink\\ntook wing and landed in a potted palm.  Then Marco gripped my hand in\\nsuch a way I had to choose between following him on to the floor or\\nhaving my arm torn off.\\n\\n\\'It\\'s a tango.\\'  Marco manoeuvred me out among the dancers.  \\'I love\\ntangos.\\'\\n\\n\\'I can\\'t dance.\\'\\n\\n\\'You don\\'t have to dance.  I\\'ll do the dancing.\\'\\n\\nMarco hooked an arm around my waist and jerked me up against his\\ndazzling white suit.  Then he said, \\'Pretend you are drowning.\\'\\n\\nI shut my eyes, and the music broke over me like a rainstorm.  Marco\\'s\\nleg slid forward against mine and my leg slid back and I seemed to be\\nriveted to him, limb for limb, moving as he moved, without any will or\\nknowledge of my own, and after a while I thought, \\'It doesn\\'t take two\\nto dance, it only takes one,\\' and I let myself blow and bend like a\\ntree in the wind.\\n\\n\\'What did I tell you?\\'  Marco\\'s breath scorched my ear.  \\'You\\'re a\\nperfectly respectable dancer.\\'\\n\\nI began to see why woman-haters could make such fools of women.\\nWoman-haters were like gods: invulnerable and chock-full of power.\\nThey descended, and then they disappeared.  You could never catch one.\\n\\nAfter the South American music there was an interval.\\n\\nMarco led me through the French doors into the garden.  Lights and\\nvoices spilled from the ballroom window, but a few yards beyond the\\ndarkness drew up its barricade and sealed them off.  In the\\ninfinitesimal glow of the stars, the trees and flowers were strewing\\ntheir cool odours.  There was no moon.\\n\\nThe box hedges shut behind us.  A deserted golf course stretched away\\ntowards a few hilly clumps of trees, and I felt the whole desolate\\nfamiliarity of the scene--the country club and the dance and the lawn\\nwith its single cricket.\\n\\nI didn\\'t know where I was, but it was somewhere in the wealthy suburbs\\nof New York.\\n\\nMarco produced a slim cigar and a silver lighter in the shape of a\\nbullet.  He set the cigar between his lips and bent over the small\\nflare.  His face, with its exaggerated shadows and planes of light,\\nlooked alien and pained, like a refugee\\'s.\\n\\nI watched him.\\n\\n\\'Who are you in love with?\\' I said then.\\n\\nFor a minute Marco didn\\'t say anything, he simply opened his mouth and\\nbreathed out a blue, vaporous ring.\\n\\n\\'Perfect!\\' he laughed.\\n\\nThe ring widened and blurred, ghost-pale on the dark air.\\n\\nThen he said, \\'I am in love with my cousin.\\'\\n\\nI felt no surprise.\\n\\n\\'Why don\\'t you marry her?\\'\\n\\n\\'Impossible.\\'\\n\\n\\'Why?\\'\\n\\nMarco shrugged.  \\'She\\'s my first cousin.  She\\'s going to be a nun.\\'\\n\\n\\'Is she beautiful?\\'\\n\\n\\'There\\'s no one to touch her.\\'\\n\\n\\'Does she know you love her?\\'\\n\\n\\'Of course.\\'\\n\\nI paused.  The obstacle seemed unreal to me.\\n\\n\\'If you love her,\\' I said, \\'you\\'ll love somebody else someday.\\'\\n\\nMarco dashed his cigar underfoot.\\n\\nThe ground soared and struck me with a soft shock.  Mud squirmed\\nthrough my fingers.  Marco waited until I half rose.  Then he put both\\nhands on my shoulders and flung me back.\\n\\n\\'My dress...\\'\\n\\n\\'Your dress!\\'  The mud oozed and adjusted itself to my shoulder blades.\\n\\'Your dress!\\'  Marco\\'s face lowered cloudily over mine.  A few drops of\\nspit struck my lips.  \\'Your dress is black and the dirt is black as\\nwell.\\'\\n\\nThen he threw himself face down as if he would grind his body through\\nme and into the mud.\\n\\n\\'It\\'s happening,\\' I thought.  \\'It\\'s happening.  If I just lie here and\\ndo nothing it will happen.\\'\\n\\nMarco set his teeth to the strap at my shoulder and tore my sheath to\\nthe waist.  I saw the glimmer of bare skin, like a pale veil separating\\ntwo bloody-minded adversaries.\\n\\n\\'Slut!\\'\\n\\nThe word hissed by my ear.\\n\\n\\'Slut!\\'\\n\\nThe dust cleared, and I had a full view of the battle.\\n\\nI began to writhe and bite.\\n\\nMarco weighed me to the earth.\\n\\n\\'Slut!\\'\\n\\nI gouged at his leg with the sharp heel of my shoe.  He turned,\\nfumbling for the hurt.\\n\\nThen I fisted my fingers together and smashed them at his nose.  It was\\nlike hitting the steel plate of a battleship.  Marco sat up.  I began\\nto cry.\\n\\nMarco pulled out a white handkerchief and dabbed his nose.  Blackness,\\nlike ink, spread over the pale cloth.\\n\\nI sucked at my salty knuckles.\\n\\n\\'I want Doreen.\\'\\n\\nMarco stared off across the golf links.\\n\\n\\'I want Doreen.  I want to go home.\\'\\n\\n\\'Sluts, all sluts.\\'  Marco seemed to be talking to himself.  \\'Yes or\\nno, it is all the same.\\'\\n\\nI poked Marco\\'s shoulder.\\n\\n\\'Where\\'s Doreen?\\'\\n\\nMarco snorted.  \\'Go to the parking lot.  Look in the backs of all the\\ncars.\\'\\n\\nThen he spun round.\\n\\n\\'My diamond.\\'\\n\\nI got up and retrieved my stole from the darkness.  I started to walk\\noff.  Marco sprang to his feet and blocked my path.  Then,\\ndeliberately, he wiped his finger under his bloody nose and with two\\nstrokes stained my cheeks.  \\'I have earned my diamond with this blood.\\nGive it to me.\\'\\n\\n\\'I don\\'t know where it is.\\'\\n\\nNow I knew perfectly well that the diamond was in my evening bag and\\nthat when Marco knocked me down my evening bag had soared, like a night\\nbird, into the enveloping darkness.  I began to think I would lead him\\naway and then return on my own and hunt for it.\\n\\nI had no idea what a diamond that size would buy, but whatever it was,\\nI knew it would be a lot.\\n\\nMarco took my shoulders in both hands.\\n\\n\\'Tell me,\\' he said, giving each word equal emphasis.  \\'Tell me, or I\\'ll\\nbreak your neck.\\'\\n\\nSuddenly I didn\\'t care.\\n\\n\\'It\\'s in my imitation jet bead evening bag,\\' I said.  \\'Somewhere in the\\nmuck.\\'\\n\\nI left Marco on his hands and knees, scrabbling in the darkness for\\nanother, smaller darkness that hid the light of his diamond from his\\nfurious eyes.\\n\\nDoreen was not in the ballroom nor in the parking lot.\\n\\nI kept to the fringe of the shadows so nobody would notice the grass\\nplastered to my dress and shoes, and with my black stole I covered my\\nshoulders and bare breasts.\\n\\nLuckily for me, the dance was nearly over, and groups of people were\\nleaving and coming out to the parked cars.  I asked at one car after\\nanother until finally I found a car that had room and would drop me in\\nthe middle of Manhattan.\\n\\n\\nAt that vague hour between dark and dawn, the sunroof of the Amazon was\\ndeserted.\\n\\nQuiet as a burglar in my cornflower-sprigged bathrobe, I crept to the\\nedge of the parapet.  The parapet reached almost to my shoulders, so I\\ndragged a folding chair from the stack against the wall, opened it, and\\nclimbed on to the precarious seat.\\n\\nA stiff breeze lifted the hair from my head.  At my feet, the city\\ndoused its lights in sleep, its buildings blackened, as if for a\\nfuneral.\\n\\nIt was my last night.\\n\\nI grasped the bundle I carried and pulled at a pale tail.  A strapless\\nelasticized slip which, in the course of wear, had lost its elasticity,\\nslumped into my hand.  I waved it, like a flag of truce, once, twice...\\nThe breeze caught it, and I let go.\\n\\nA white flake floated out into the night, and began its slow descent.\\nI wondered on what street or rooftop it would come to rest.\\n\\nI tugged at the bundle again.\\n\\nThe wind made an effort, but failed, and a batlike shadow sank towards\\nthe roof garden of the penthouse opposite.\\n\\nPiece by piece, I fed my wardrobe to the night wind, and flutteringly,\\nlike a loved one\\'s ashes, the grey scraps were ferried off, to settle\\nhere, there, exactly where I would never know, in the dark heart of New\\nYork.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter Ten\\n\\nThe face in the mirror looked like a sick Indian.\\n\\nI dropped the compact into my pocket-book and stared out of the train\\nwindow.  Like a colossal junkyard, the swamps and back lots of\\nConnecticut flashed past, one broken-down fragment bearing no relation\\nto another.\\n\\nWhat a hotch-potch the world was!\\n\\nI glanced down at my unfamiliar skirt and blouse.\\n\\nThe skirt was a green dirndl with tiny black, white and electric blue\\nshapes swarming across it, and it stuck out like a lampshade.  Instead\\nof sleeves, the white eyelet blouse had frills at the shoulder, floppy\\nas the wings of a new angel.\\n\\nI\\'d forgotten to save any day clothes from the ones I let fly over New\\nYork, so Betsy had traded me a blouse and skirt for my bathrobe with\\nthe cornflowers on it.\\n\\nA wan reflection of myself, white wings, brown ponytail and all,\\nghosted over the landscape.\\n\\n\\'Pollyanna Cowgirl,\\' I said out loud.\\n\\nA woman in the seat opposite looked up from her magazine.\\n\\nI hadn\\'t, at the last moment, felt like washing off the two diagonal\\nlines of dried blood that marked my cheeks.  They seemed touching, and\\nrather spectacular, and I thought I would carry them around with me,\\nlike the relic of a dead lover, till they wore off of their own accord.\\n\\nOf course, if I smiled or moved my face much, the blood would flake\\naway in no time, so I kept my face immobile, and when I had to speak I\\nspoke through my teeth, without disturbing my lips.\\n\\nI didn\\'t really see why people should look at me.\\n\\nPlenty of people looked queerer than I did.\\n\\nMy grey suitcase rode on the rack over my head, empty except for _The\\nThirty Best Short Stories of the Year_, a white plastic sunglasses case\\nand two dozen avocado pears, a parting present from Doreen.\\n\\nThe pears were unripe, so they would keep well, and whenever I lifted\\nmy suitcase up or down or simply carried it along, they cannoned from\\none end to the other with a special little thunder of their own.\\n\\n\\'Root Wan Twenny Ate!\\' the conductor bawled.\\n\\nThe domesticated wilderness of pine, maple and oak rolled to a halt and\\nstuck in the frame of the train window like a bad picture.  My suitcase\\ngrumbled and bumped as I negotiated the long aisle.\\n\\nI stepped from the air-conditioned compartment on to the station\\nplatform, and the motherly breath of the suburbs enfolded me.  It smelt\\nof lawn sprinklers and station-wagons and tennis rackets and dogs and\\nbabies.\\n\\nA summer calm laid its soothing hand over everything, like death.\\n\\nMy mother was waiting by the glove-grey Chevrolet.\\n\\n\\'Why lovey, what\\'s happened to your face?\\'\\n\\n\\'Cut myself,\\' I said briefly, and crawled into the back seat after my\\nsuitcase.  I didn\\'t want her staring at me the whole way home.\\n\\nThe upholstery felt slippery and clean.\\n\\nMy mother climbed behind the wheel and tossed a few letters into my\\nlap, then turned her back.\\n\\nThe car purred into life.\\n\\n\\'I think I should tell you right away,\\' she said, and I could see bad\\nnews in the set of her neck, \\'you didn\\'t make that writing course.\\'\\n\\nThe air punched out of my stomach.\\n\\nAll through June the writing course had stretched before me like a\\nbright, safe bridge over the dull gulf of the summer.  Now I saw it\\ntotter and dissolve, and a body in a white blouse and green skirt\\nplummet into the gap.\\n\\nThen my mouth shaped itself sourly.\\n\\nI had expected it.\\n\\nI slunk down on the middle of my spine, my nose level with the rim of\\nthe window, and watched the houses of outer Boston glide by.  As the\\nhouses grew more familiar, I slunk still lower.\\n\\nI felt it was very important not to be recognized.\\n\\nThe grey, padded car roof closed over my head like the roof of a prison\\nvan, and the white, shining, identical clapboard houses with their\\ninterstices of well-groomed green proceeded past, one bar after another\\nin a large but escape-proof cage.\\n\\nI had never spent a summer in the suburbs before.\\n\\n\\nThe soprano screak of carriage wheels punished my ear.  Sun, seeping\\nthrough the blinds, filled the bedroom with a sulphurous light.  I\\ndidn\\'t know how long I had slept, but I felt one big twitch of\\nexhaustion.\\n\\nThe twin bed next to mine was empty and unmade.\\n\\nAt seven I had heard my mother get up, slip into her clothes and tiptoe\\nout of the room.  Then the buzz of the orange squeezer sounded from\\ndownstairs, and the smell of coffee and bacon filtered under my door.\\nThen the sink water ran from the tap and dishes clinked as my mother\\ndried them and put them back in the cupboard.\\n\\nThen the front door opened and shut.  Then the car door opened and\\nshut, and the motor went broom-broom and, edging off with a crunch of\\ngravel, faded into the distance.\\n\\nMy mother was teaching shorthand and typing to a lot of city college\\ngirls and wouldn\\'t be home till the middle of the afternoon.\\n\\nThe carriage wheels screaked past again.  Somebody seemed to be\\nwheeling a baby back and forth under my window.\\n\\nI slipped out of bed and on to the rug, and quietly, on my hands and\\nknees, crawled over to see who it was.\\n\\nOurs was a small, white clapboard house set in the middle of a small\\ngreen lawn on the corner of two peaceful suburban streets, but in spite\\nof the little maple trees planted at intervals around our property,\\nanybody passing along the sidewalk could glance up at the second storey\\nwindows and see just what was going on.\\n\\nThis was brought home to me by our next-door neighbour, a spiteful\\nwoman named Mrs Ockenden.\\n\\nMrs Ockenden was a retired nurse who had just married her third\\nhusband--the other two died in curious circumstances--and she spent an\\ninordinate amount of time peering from behind the starched white\\ncurtains of her windows.\\n\\nShe had called my mother up twice about me--once to report that I had\\nbeen sitting in front of the house for an hour under the streetlight\\nand kissing somebody in a blue Plymouth, and once to say that I had\\nbetter pull the blinds down in my room, because she had seen me\\nhalf-naked getting ready for bed one night when she happened to be out\\nwalking her Scotch terrier.\\n\\nWith great care, I raised my eyes to the level of the window-sill.\\n\\nA woman not five feet tall, with a grotesque, protruding stomach, was\\nwheeling an old black baby carriage down the street.  Two or three\\nsmall children of various sizes, all pale, with smudgy faces and bare\\nsmudgy knees, wobbled along in the shadow of her skirts.\\n\\nA serene, almost religious smile lit up the woman\\'s face.  Her head\\ntilted happily back, like a sparrow egg perched on a duck egg, she\\nsmiled into the sun.\\n\\nI knew the woman well.\\n\\nIt was Dodo Conway.\\n\\nDodo Conway was a Catholic who had gone to Barnard and then married an\\narchitect who had gone to Columbia and was also a Catholic.  They had a\\nbig, rambling house up the street from us, set behind a morbid façade\\nof pine trees, and surrounded by scooters, tricycles, doll carriages,\\ntoy fire trucks, baseball bats, badminton nets, croquet wickets,\\nhamster cages and cocker spaniel puppies--the whole sprawling\\nparaphernalia of suburban childhood.\\n\\nDodo interested me in spite of myself.\\n\\nHer house was unlike all the others in our neighbourhood in its size\\n(it was much bigger) and its colour (the second storey was constructed\\nof dark brown clapboard and the first of grey stucco, studded with grey\\nand purple golf-ball-shaped stones), and the pine trees completely\\nscreened it from view, which was considered unsociable in our community\\nof adjoining lawns and friendly, waist-high hedges.\\n\\nDodo raised her six children--and would no doubt raise her seventh--on\\nrice crispies, peanut-butter-and-marshmallow sandwiches, vanilla\\nice-cream and gallon upon gallon of Hoods milk.  She got a special\\ndiscount from the local milkman.\\n\\nEverybody loved Dodo, although the swelling size of her family was the\\ntalk of the neighbourhood.  The older people around, like my mother,\\nhad two children, and the younger, more prosperous ones had four, but\\nnobody but Dodo was on the verge of a seventh.  Even six was considered\\nexcessive, but then, everybody said, of course Dodo was a Catholic.\\n\\nI watched Dodo wheel the youngest Conway up and down.  She seemed to be\\ndoing it for my benefit.\\n\\nChildren made me sick.\\n\\nA floorboard creaked, and I ducked down again, just as Dodo Conway\\'s\\nface, by instinct, or some gift of supernatural hearing, turned on the\\nlittle pivot of its neck.\\n\\nI felt her gaze pierce through the white clapboard and the pink,\\nwallpaper roses and uncover me, crouching there behind the silver\\npickets of the radiator.\\n\\nI crawled back into bed and pulled the sheet over my head.  But even\\nthat didn\\'t shut out the light, so I buried my head under the darkness\\nof the pillow and pretended it was night.  I couldn\\'t see the point of\\ngetting up.\\n\\nI had nothing to look forward to.\\n\\nAfter a while I heard the telephone ringing in the downstairs hall.  I\\nstuffed the pillow into my ears and gave myself five minutes.  Then I\\nlifted my head from its bolt hole.  The ringing had stopped.\\n\\nAlmost at once it started up again.\\n\\nCursing whatever friend, relative or stranger had sniffed out my\\nhomecoming, I padded barefoot downstairs.  The black instrument on the\\nhall table trilled its hysterical note over and over, like a nervous\\nbird.\\n\\nI picked up the receiver.\\n\\n\\'Hullo,\\' I said, in a low, disguised voice.\\n\\n\\'Hullo Esther, what\\'s the matter, have you got laryngitis?\\'\\n\\nIt was my old friend Jody, calling from Cambridge.\\n\\nJody was working at the Co-op that summer and taking a lunchtime course\\nin sociology.  She and two other girls from my college had rented a big\\napartment from four Harvard law students, and I\\'d been planning to move\\nin with them when my writing course began.\\n\\nJody wanted to know when they could expect me.\\n\\n\\'I\\'m not coming,\\' I said.  \\'I didn\\'t make the course.\\'\\n\\nThere was a small pause.\\n\\n\\'He\\'s an ass,\\' Jody said then.  \\'He doesn\\'t know a good thing when he\\nsees it.\\'\\n\\n\\'My sentiments exactly.\\'  My voice sounded strange and hollow in my\\nears.\\n\\n\\'Come anyway.  Take some other course.\\'\\n\\nThe notion of studying German or abnormal psychology flitted through my\\nhead.  After all, I\\'d saved nearly the whole of my New York salary, so\\nI could just about afford it.\\n\\nBut the hollow voice said, \\'You better count me out.\\'\\n\\n\\'Well,\\' Jody began, \\'there\\'s this other girl who wanted to come in with\\nus if anybody dropped out...\\'\\n\\n\\'Fine.  Ask her.\\'\\n\\nThe minute I hung up I knew I should have said I would come.  One more\\nmorning listening to Dodo Conway\\'s baby carriage would drive me crazy.\\nAnd I made a point of never living in the same house with my mother for\\nmore than a week.\\n\\nI reached for the receiver.\\n\\nMy hand advanced a few inches, then retreated and fell limp.  I forced\\nit towards the receiver again, but again it stopped short, as if it had\\ncollided with a pane of glass.\\n\\nI wandered into the dining-room.\\n\\nPropped on the table I found a long, business-like letter from the\\nsummer school and a thin blue letter on left-over Yale stationery,\\naddressed to me in Buddy Willard\\'s lucid hand.\\n\\nI slit open the summer school letter with a knife.\\n\\nSince I wasn\\'t accepted for the writing course, it said, I could choose\\nsome other course instead, but I should call in to the Admissions\\nOffice that same morning, or it would be too late to register, the\\ncourses were almost full.\\n\\nI dialled the Admissions Office and listened to the zombie voice leave\\na message that Miss Esther Greenwood was cancelling all arrangements to\\ncome to summer school.\\n\\nThen I opened Buddy Willard\\'s letter.\\n\\nBuddy wrote that he was probably falling in love with a nurse who also\\nhad TB, but his mother had rented a cottage in the Adirondacks for the\\nmonth of July, and if I came along with her, he might well find his\\nfeeling for the nurse was a mere infatuation.\\n\\nI snatched up a pencil and crossed out Buddy\\'s message.  Then I turned\\nthe letter paper over and on the opposite side wrote that I was engaged\\nto a simultaneous interpreter and never wanted to see Buddy again as I\\ndid not want to give my children a hypocrite for a father.\\n\\nI stuck the letter back in the envelope, scotch-taped it together, and\\nreaddressed it to Buddy, without putting on a new stamp.  I thought the\\nmessage was worth a good three cents.\\n\\nThen I decided I would spend the summer writing a novel.\\n\\nThat would fix a lot of people.\\n\\nI strolled into the kitchen, dropped a raw egg into a teacup of raw\\nhamburg, mixed it up and ate it.  Then I set up the card-table on the\\nscreened breezeway between the house and the garage.\\n\\nA great wallowing bush of mock orange shut off the view of the street\\nin front, the house wall and the garage wall took care of either side,\\nand a clump of birches and a box hedge protected me from Mrs Ockenden\\nat the back.\\n\\nI counted out three hundred and fifty sheets of corrasable bond from my\\nmother\\'s stock in the hall closet, secreted away under a pile of old\\nfelt hats and clothes brushes and woollen scarves.\\n\\nBack on the breezeway, I fed the first, virgin sheet into my old\\nportable and rolled it up.\\n\\nFrom another, distanced mind, I saw myself sitting on the breezeway,\\nsurrounded by two white clapboard walls, a mock orange bush and a clump\\nof birches and a box hedge, small as a doll in a doll\\'s house.\\n\\nA feeling of tenderness filled my heart.  My heroine would be myself,\\nonly in disguise.  She would be called Elaine.  Elaine.  I counted the\\nletters on my fingers.  There were six letters in Esther, too.  It\\nseemed a lucky thing.\\n\\n\\n_Elaine sat on the breezeway in an old yellow nightgown of her\\nmother\\'s, waiting for something to happen.  It was a sweltering morning\\nin July, and drops of sweat crawled down her back, one by one, like\\nslow insects._\\n\\n\\nI leaned back and read what I had written.\\n\\nIt seemed lively enough, and I was quite proud of the bit about the\\ndrops of sweat like insects, only I had the dim impression I\\'d probably\\nread it somewhere else a long time ago.\\n\\nI sat like that for about an hour, trying to think what would come\\nnext, and in my mind, the barefoot doll in her mother\\'s old yellow\\nnightgown sat and stared into space as well.\\n\\n\\'Why honey, don\\'t you want to get dressed?\\'\\n\\nMy mother took care never to tell me to do anything.  She would only\\nreason with me sweetly, like one intelligent, mature person with\\nanother.\\n\\n\\'It\\'s almost three in the afternoon.\\'\\n\\n\\'I\\'m writing a novel,\\' I said.  \\'I haven\\'t got time to change out of\\nthis and change into that.\\'\\n\\nI lay on the couch on the breezeway and shut my eyes.  I could hear my\\nmother clearing the typewriter and the papers from the card-table and\\nlaying out the silver for supper, but I didn\\'t move.\\n\\n\\n_Inertia oozed like molasses through Elaine\\'s limbs.  That\\'s what it\\nmust feel like to have malaria, she thought._\\n\\n\\nAt that rate, I\\'d be lucky if I wrote a page a day.\\n\\nThen I knew what the trouble was.\\n\\nI needed experience.\\n\\nHow could I write about life when I\\'d never had a love affair or a baby\\nor seen anybody die?  A girl I knew had just won a prize for a short\\nstory about her adventures among the pygmies in Africa.  How could I\\ncompete with that sort of thing?\\n\\nBy the end of supper my mother had convinced me I should study\\nshorthand in the evenings.  Then I would be killing two birds with one\\nstone, writing a novel and learning something practical as well.  I\\nwould also be saving a whole lot of money.\\n\\nThat same evening, my mother unearthed an old blackboard from the\\ncellar and set it up on the breezeway.  Then she stood at the\\nblackboard and scribbled little curlicues in white chalk while I sat in\\na chair and watched.\\n\\nAt first I felt hopeful.\\n\\nI thought I might learn shorthand in no time, and when the freckled\\nlady in the Scholarhips Office asked me why I hadn\\'t worked to earn\\nmoney in July and August, the way you were supposed to if you were a\\nscholarship girl, I could tell her I had taken a free shorthand course\\ninstead, so I could support myself right after college.\\n\\nThe only thing was, when I tried to picture myself in some job, briskly\\njotting down line after line of shorthand, my mind went blank.  There\\nwasn\\'t one job I felt like doing where you used shorthand.  And, as I\\nsat there and watched, the white chalk curlicues blurred into\\nsenselessness.\\n\\nI told my mother I had a terrible headache, and went to bed.\\n\\nAn hour later the door inched open, and she crept into the room.  I\\nheard the whisper of her clothes as she undressed.  She climbed into\\nbed.  Then her breathing grew slow and regular.\\n\\nIn the dim light of the streetlamp that filtered through the drawn\\nblinds, I could see the pin curls on her head glittering like a row of\\nlittle bayonets.\\n\\nI decided I would put off the novel until I had gone to Europe and had\\na lover, and that I would never learn a word of shorthand.  If I never\\nlearned shorthand I would never have to use it.\\n\\nI thought I would spend the summer reading _Finnegan\\'s Wake_ and\\nwriting my thesis.\\n\\nThen I would be way ahead when college started at the end of September,\\nand able to enjoy my last year instead of swotting away with no make-up\\nand stringy hair, on a diet of coffee and benzedrine, the way most of\\nthe seniors taking honours did, until they finished their thesis.\\n\\nThen I thought I might put off college for a year and apprentice myself\\nto a pottery maker.\\n\\nOr work my way to Germany and be a waitress, until I was bilingual.\\n\\nThen plan after plan started leaping through my head, like a family of\\nscatty rabbits.\\n\\nI saw the years of my life spaced along a road in the form of telephone\\npoles, threaded together by wires.  I counted one, two, three ...\\nnineteen telephone poles, and then the wires dangled into space, and\\ntry as I would, I couldn\\'t see a single pole beyond the nineteenth.\\n\\nThe room blued into view, and I wondered where the night had gone.  My\\nmother turned from a foggy log into a slumbering, middle-aged woman,\\nher mouth slightly open and a snore ravelling from her throat.  The\\npiggish noise irritated me, and for a while it seemed to me that the\\nonly way to stop it would be to take the column of skin and sinew from\\nwhich it rose and twist it to silence between my hands.\\n\\nI feigned sleep until my mother left for school, but even my eyelids\\ndidn\\'t shut out the light.  They hung the raw, red screen of their tiny\\nvessels in front of me like a wound.  I crawled between the mattress\\nand the padded bedstead and let the mattress fall across me like a\\ntombstone.  It felt dark and safe under there, but the mattress was not\\nheavy enough.\\n\\nIt needed about a ton more weight to make me sleep.\\n\\n\\n_riverrun, past Eve and Adam\\'s, from swerve of shore to bend of bay,\\nbrings us by a commodius vicus of recirculation back to Howth Castle\\nand Environs..._\\n\\n\\nThe thick book made an unpleasant dent in my stomach.\\n\\n\\n_riverrun, past Eve and Adam\\'s..._\\n\\n\\nI thought the small letter at the start might mean that nothing ever\\nreally began all new, with a capital, but that it just flowed on from\\nwhat came before.  Eve and Adam\\'s was Adam and Eve, of course, but it\\nprobably signified something else as well.\\n\\nMaybe it was a pub in Dublin.\\n\\nMy eyes sank through an alphabet soup of letters to the long word in\\nthe middle of the page.\\n\\n\\n_bababadalgharaghtakamminarronnkonnbronntonnenonnruonnthu-\\nnntrovarrhounawnskawntoohoohoordenenthurnuk!_\\n\\n\\nI counted the letters.  There were exactly a hundred of them.  I\\nthought this must be important.\\n\\nWhy should there be a hundred letters?\\n\\nHaltingly, I tried the word aloud.\\n\\nIt sounded like a heavy wooden object falling downstairs, boomp boomp\\nboomp, step after step.  Lifting the pages of the book, I let them fan\\nslowly by my eyes.  Words, dimly familiar, but twisted all awry, like\\nfaces in a funhouse mirror, fled past, leaving no impression on the\\nglassy surface of my brain.\\n\\nI squinted at the page.\\n\\nThe letters grew barbs and rams\\' horns.  I watched them separate, each\\nfrom the other, and jiggle up and down in a silly way.  Then they\\nassociated themselves in fantastic, untranslatable shapes, like Arabic\\nor Chinese.\\n\\nI decided to junk my thesis.\\n\\nI decided to junk the whole honours programme and become an ordinary\\nEnglish major.  I went to look up the requirements of an ordinary\\nEnglish major at my college.\\n\\nThere were lots of requirements, and I didn\\'t have half of them.  One\\nof the requirements was a course in the eighteenth century.  I hated\\nthe very idea of the eighteenth century, with all those smug men\\nwriting tight little couplets and being so dead keen on reason.  So I\\'d\\nskipped it.  They let you do that in honours, you were much freer.  I\\nhad been so free I\\'d spent most of my time on Dylan Thomas.\\n\\nA friend of mine, also in honours, had managed never to read a word of\\nShakespeare; but she was a real expert on the _Four Quartets_.\\n\\nI saw how impossible and embarrassing it would be for me to try to\\nswitch from my free programme into the stricter one.  So I looked up\\nthe requirements for English majors at the city college where my mother\\ntaught.\\n\\nThey were even worse.\\n\\nYou had to know Old English and the History of the English Language and\\na representative selection of all that had been written from Beowulf to\\nthe present day.\\n\\nThis surprised me.  I had always looked down on my mother\\'s college, as\\nit was co-ed, and filled with people who couldn\\'t get scholarships to\\nthe big eastern colleges.\\n\\nNow I saw that the stupidest person at my mother\\'s college knew more\\nthan I did.  I saw they wouldn\\'t even let me in through the door, let\\nalone give me a large scholarship like the one I had at my own college.\\n\\nI thought I\\'d better go to work for a year and think things over.\\nMaybe I could study the eighteenth century in secret.\\n\\nBut I didn\\'t know shorthand, so what could I do?\\n\\nI could be a waitress or a typist.\\n\\nBut I couldn\\'t stand the idea of being either one.\\n\\n\\n\\'You say you want more sleeping pills?\\'\\n\\n\\'Yes.\\'\\n\\n\\'But the ones I gave you last week are very strong.\\'\\n\\n\\'They don\\'t work any more.\\'\\n\\nTeresa\\'s large, dark eyes regarded me thoughtfully.  I could hear the\\nvoices of her three children in the garden under the consulting-room\\nwindow.  My Aunt Libby had married an Italian, and Teresa was my aunt\\'s\\nsister-in-law and our family doctor.\\n\\nI liked Teresa.  She had a gentle, intuitive touch.\\n\\nI thought it must be because she was Italian.\\n\\nThere was a little pause.\\n\\n\\'What seems to be the matter?\\' Teresa said then.\\n\\n\\'I can\\'t sleep.  I can\\'t read.\\'  I tried to speak in a cool, calm way,\\nbut the zombie rose up in my throat and choked me off.  I turned my\\nhands palm up.\\n\\n\\'I think,\\' Teresa tore off a white slip from her prescription pad and\\nwrote down a name and address, \\'you\\'d better see another doctor I know.\\nHe\\'ll be able to help you more than I can.\\'\\n\\nI peered at the writing, but I couldn\\'t read it.\\n\\n\\'Doctor Gordon,\\' Teresa said.  \\'He\\'s a psychiatrist.\\'\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter Eleven\\n\\nDoctor Gordon\\'s waiting-room was hushed and beige.\\n\\nThe walls were beige, and the carpets were beige, and the upholstered\\nchairs and sofas were beige.  There were no mirrors or pictures, only\\ncertificates from different medical schools, with Doctor Gordon\\'s name\\nin Latin, hung about the walls.  Pale green loopy ferns and spiked\\nleaves of a much darker green filled the ceramic pots on the end-table\\nand the coffee-table and the magazine-table.\\n\\nAt first I wondered why the room felt so safe.  Then I realized it was\\nbecause there were no windows.\\n\\nThe air-conditioning made me shiver.\\n\\nI was still wearing Betsy\\'s white blouse and dirndl skirt.  They\\ndrooped a bit now, as I hadn\\'t washed them in my three weeks at home.\\nThe sweaty cotton gave off a sour but friendly smell.\\n\\nI hadn\\'t washed my hair for three weeks, either.\\n\\nI hadn\\'t slept for seven nights.\\n\\nMy mother told me I must have slept, it was impossible not to sleep in\\nall that time, but if I slept, it was with my eyes wide open, for I had\\nfollowed the green, luminous course of the second hand and the minute\\nhand and the hour hand of the bedside clock through their circles and\\nsemi-circles, every night for seven nights, without missing a second,\\nor a minute, or an hour.\\n\\nThe reason I hadn\\'t washed my clothes or my hair was because it seemed\\nso silly.\\n\\nI saw the days of the year stretching ahead like a series of bright,\\nwhite boxes, and separating one box from another was sleep, like a\\nblack shade.  Only for me, the long perspective of shades that set off\\none box from the next had suddenly snapped up, and I could see day\\nafter day after day glaring ahead of me like a white, broad, infinitely\\ndesolate avenue.\\n\\nIt seemed silly to wash one day when I would only have to wash again\\nthe next.\\n\\nIt made me tired just to think of it.\\n\\nI wanted to do everything once and for all and be through with it.\\n\\n\\nDoctor Gordon twiddled a silver pencil.\\n\\n\\'Your mother tells me you are upset.\\'\\n\\nI curled in the cavernous leather chair and faced Doctor Gordon across\\nan acre of highly polished desk.\\n\\nDoctor Gordon waited.  He tapped his pencil--tap, tap, tap--across the\\nneat green field of his blotter.\\n\\nHis eyelashes were so long and thick they looked artificial.  Black\\nplastic reeds fringing two green, glacial pools.\\n\\nDoctor Gordon\\'s features were so perfect he was almost pretty.\\n\\nI hated him the minute I walked in through the door.\\n\\nI had imagined a kind, ugly, intuitive man looking up and saying \\'Ah!\\'\\nin an encouraging way, as if he could see something I couldn\\'t, and\\nthen I would find words to tell him how I was so scared, as if I were\\nbeing stuffed farther and farther into a black, airless sack with no\\nway out.\\n\\nThen he would lean back in his chair and match the tips of his fingers\\ntogether in a little steeple and tell me why I couldn\\'t sleep and why I\\ncouldn\\'t read and why I couldn\\'t eat and why everything people did\\nseemed so silly, because they only died in the end.\\n\\nAnd then, I thought, he would help me, step by step, to be myself again.\\n\\nBut Doctor Gordon wasn\\'t like that at all.  He was young and\\ngood-looking, and I could see right away he was conceited.\\n\\nDoctor Gordon had a photograph on his desk, in a silver frame, that\\nhalf faced him and half faced my leather chair.  It was a family\\nphotograph, and it showed a beautiful dark-haired woman, who could have\\nbeen Doctor Gordon\\'s sister, smiling out over the heads of two blond\\nchildren.\\n\\nI think one child was a boy and one was a girl, but it may have been\\nthat both children were boys or that both were girls, it is hard to\\ntell when children are so small.  I think there was also a dog in the\\npicture, towards the bottom--a kind of airedale or a golden\\nretriever--but it may have only been the pattern in the woman\\'s skirt.\\n\\nFor some reason the photograph made me furious.\\n\\nI didn\\'t see why it should be turned half towards me unless Doctor\\nGordon was trying to show me right away that he was married to some\\nglamorous woman and I\\'d better not get any funny ideas.\\n\\nThen I thought, how could this Doctor Gordon help me anyway, with a\\nbeautiful wife and beautiful children and a beautiful dog haloing him\\nlike the angels on a Christmas card?\\n\\n\\'Suppose you try and tell me what you think is wrong.\\'\\n\\nI turned the words over suspiciously, like round, sea-polished pebbles\\nthat might suddenly put out a claw and change into something else.\\n\\nWhat did I _think_ was wrong?\\n\\nThat made it sound as if nothing was _really_ wrong, I only thought it\\nwas wrong.\\n\\nIn a dull, flat voice--to show I was not beguiled by his good looks or\\nhis family photograph--I told Doctor Gordon about not sleeping and not\\neating and not reading.  I didn\\'t tell him about the handwriting, which\\nbothered me most of all.\\n\\nThat morning I had tried to write a letter to Doreen, down in West\\nVirginia, asking whether I could come and live with her and maybe get a\\njob at her college waiting on table or something.\\n\\nBut when I took up my pen, my hand made big, jerky letters like those\\nof a child, and the lines sloped down the page from left to right\\nalmost diagonally, as if they were loops of string lying on the paper,\\nand someone had come along and blown them askew.\\n\\nI knew I couldn\\'t send a letter like that, so I tore it up in little\\npieces and put them in my pocket-book, next to my all-purpose compact,\\nin case the psychiatrist asked to see them.\\n\\nBut of course Doctor Gordon didn\\'t ask to see them, as I hadn\\'t\\nmentioned them, and I began to feel pleased at my cleverness.  I\\nthought I only need tell him what I wanted to, and that I could control\\nthe picture he had of me by hiding this and revealing that, all the\\nwhile he thought he was so smart.\\n\\nThe whole time I was talking, Doctor Gordon bent his head as if he were\\npraying, and the only noise apart from the dull, flat voice was the\\ntap, tap, tap of Doctor Gordon\\'s pencil at the same point on the green\\nblotter, like a stalled walking-stick.\\n\\nWhen I had finished, Doctor Gordon lifted his head.\\n\\n\\'Where did you say you went to college?\\'\\n\\nBaffled, I told him.  I didn\\'t see where college fitted in.\\n\\n\\'Ah!\\'  Doctor Gordon leaned back in his chair, staring into the air\\nover my shoulder with a reminiscent smile.\\n\\nI thought he was going to tell me his diagnosis, and that perhaps I had\\njudged him too hastily and too unkindly.  But he only said, \\'I remember\\nyour college well.  I was up there, during the war.  They had a WAC\\nstation, didn\\'t they?  Or was it WAVES?\\'\\n\\nI said I didn\\'t know.\\n\\n\\'Yes, a WAC station, I remember now.  I was doctor for the lot, before\\nI was sent overseas.  My, they were a pretty bunch of girls.\\'\\n\\nDoctor Gordon laughed.\\n\\nThen, in one smooth move, he rose to his feet and strolled towards me\\nround the corner of his desk.  I wasn\\'t sure what he meant to do, so I\\nstood up as well.\\n\\nDoctor Gordon reached for the hand that hung at my right side and shook\\nit.\\n\\n\\'See you next week, then.\\'\\n\\nThe full, bosomy elms made a tunnel of shade over the yellow and red\\nbrick fronts along Commonwealth Avenue, and a trolley-car was threading\\nitself towards Boston down its slim, silver track.  I waited for the\\ntrolley to pass, then crossed to the grey Chevrolet at the opposite\\ncurb.\\n\\nI could see my mother\\'s face, anxious and sallow as a slice of lemon,\\npeering up at me through the windshield.\\n\\n\\'Well, what did he say?\\'\\n\\nI pulled the car door shut.  It didn\\'t catch.  I pushed it out and drew\\nit in again with a dull slam.\\n\\n\\'He said he\\'ll see me next week.\\'\\n\\nMy mother sighed.\\n\\nDoctor Gordon cost twenty-five dollars an hour.\\n\\n\\n\\'Hi there, what\\'s your name?\\'\\n\\n\\'Elly Higginbottom.\\'\\n\\nThe sailor fell into step beside me, and I smiled.\\n\\nI thought there must be as many sailors on the Common as there were\\npigeons.  They seemed to come out of a dun-coloured recruiting house on\\nthe far side, with blue and white \\'Join the Navy\\' posters stuck up on\\nbillboards round it and all over the inner walls.\\n\\n\\'Where do you come from, Elly?\\'\\n\\n\\'Chicago.\\'\\n\\nI had never been to Chicago, but I knew one or two boys who went to\\nChicago University, and it seemed the sort of place where\\nunconventional, mixed-up people would come from.\\n\\n\\'You sure are a long way from home.\\'\\n\\nThe sailor put his arm around my waist, and for a long time we walked\\naround the Common like that, the sailor stroking my hip through the\\ngreen dirndl skirt, and me smiling mysteriously and trying not to say\\nanything that would show I was from Boston and might at any moment meet\\nMrs Willard, or one of my mother\\'s other friends, crossing the Common\\nafter tea on Beacon Hill or shopping in Filene\\'s Basement.\\n\\nI thought if I ever did get to Chicago, I might change my name to Elly\\nHigginbottom for good.  Then nobody would know I had thrown up a\\nscholarship at a big eastern women\\'s college and mucked up a month in\\nNew York and refused a perfectly solid medical student for a husband\\nwho would one day be a member of the A.M.A. and earn pots of money.\\n\\nIn Chicago, people would take me for what I was.\\n\\nI would be simple Elly Higginbottom, the orphan.  People would love me\\nfor my sweet, quiet nature.  They wouldn\\'t be after me to read books\\nand write long papers on the twins in James Joyce.  And one day I might\\njust marry a virile, but tender, garage mechanic and have a big cowy\\nfamily, like Dodo Conway.\\n\\nIf I happened to feel like it.\\n\\n\\'What do you want to do when you get out of the Navy?\\' I asked the\\nsailor suddenly.\\n\\nIt was the longest sentence I had said, and he seemed taken aback.  He\\npushed his white cup-cake cap to one side and scratched his head.\\n\\n\\'Well, I dunno, Elly,\\' he said.  \\'I might just go to college on the\\nG.I. Bill.\\'\\n\\nI paused.  Then I said suggestively, \\'You ever thought of opening a\\ngarage?\\'\\n\\n\\'Nope,\\' said the sailor, \\'Never have.\\'\\n\\nI peered at him from the corner of my eye.  He didn\\'t look a day over\\nsixteen.\\n\\n\\'Do you know how old I am?\\' I said accusingly.\\n\\nThe sailor grinned at me.  \\'Nope, and I don\\'t care either.\\'\\n\\nIt occurred to me that this sailor was really remarkably handsome.  He\\nlooked Nordic and virginal.  Now I was simple-minded it seemed I\\nattracted clean, handsome people.\\n\\n\\'Well, I\\'m thirty,\\' I said, and waited.\\n\\n\\'Gee, Elly, you don\\'t look it.\\'  The sailor squeezed my hip.\\n\\nThen he glanced quickly from left to right.  \\'Listen, Elly, if we go\\nround to those steps over there, under the monument, I can kiss you.\\'\\n\\nAt that moment I noticed a brown figure in sensible flat brown shoes\\nstriding across the Common in my direction.  From the distance, I\\ncouldn\\'t make out any features on the dime-sized face, but I knew it\\nwas Mrs Willard.\\n\\n\\'Could you please tell me the way to the subway?\\' I said to the sailor\\nin a loud voice.\\n\\n\\'Huh?\\'\\n\\n\\'The subway that goes out to the Deer Island Prison?\\'\\n\\nWhen Mrs Willard came up I would have to pretend I was only asking the\\nsailor directions, and didn\\'t really know him at all.\\n\\n\\'Take your hands off me,\\' I said between my teeth.\\n\\n\\'Say Elly, what\\'s up?\\'\\n\\nThe woman approached and passed by without a look or a nod, and of\\ncourse it wasn\\'t Mrs Willard.  Mrs Willard was at her cottage in the\\nAdirondacks.\\n\\nI fixed the woman\\'s receding back with a vengeful stare.\\n\\n\\'Say, Elly...\\'\\n\\n\\'I thought it was somebody I knew,\\' I said.  \\'Some blasted lady from\\nthis orphan home in Chicago.\\'\\n\\nThe sailor put his arm around me again.\\n\\n\\'You mean you got no mom and dad, Elly?\\'\\n\\n\\'No.\\'  I let out a tear that seemed ready.  It made a little hot track\\ndown my cheek.\\n\\n\\'Say Elly, don\\'t cry.  This lady, was she mean to you?\\'\\n\\n\\'She was ... she was _awful_!\\'\\n\\nThe tears came in a rush, then, and while the sailor was holding me and\\npatting them dry with a big, clean, white, linen handkerchief in the\\nshelter of an American elm, I thought what an awful woman that lady in\\nthe brown suit had been, and how she, whether she knew it or not, was\\nresponsible for my taking the wrong turn here and the wrong path there\\nand for everything bad that happened after that.\\n\\n\\n\\'Well, Esther, how do you feel this week?\\'\\n\\nDoctor Gordon cradled his pencil like a slim, silver bullet.\\n\\n\\'The same.\\'\\n\\n\\'The same?\\'  He quirked an eyebrow, as if he didn\\'t believe it,\\n\\nSo I told him again, in the same dull, flat voice, only it was angrier\\nthis time, because he seemed so slow to understand, how I hadn\\'t slept\\nfor fourteen nights and how I couldn\\'t read or write or swallow very\\nwell.\\n\\nDoctor Gordon seemed unimpressed.\\n\\nI dug into my pocket-book and found the scraps of my letter to Doreen.\\nI took them out and let them flutter on to Doctor Gordon\\'s immaculate\\ngreen blotter.  They lay there, dumb as daisy petals in a summer meadow.\\n\\n\\'What,\\' I said, \\'do you think of that?\\'\\n\\nI thought Doctor Gordon must immediately see how bad the handwriting\\nwas, but he only said, \\'I think I would like to speak to your mother.\\nDo you mind?\\'\\n\\n\\'No.\\'  But I didn\\'t like the idea of Doctor Gordon talking to my mother\\none bit.  I thought he might tell her I should be locked up.  I picked\\nup every scrap of my letter to Doreen, so Doctor Gordon couldn\\'t piece\\nthem together and see I was planning to run away, and walked out of his\\noffice without another word.\\n\\n\\nI watched my mother grow smaller and smaller until she disappeared into\\nthe door of Doctor Gordon\\'s office building.  Then I watched her grow\\nlarger and larger as she came back to the car.\\n\\n\\'Well?\\'  I could tell she had been crying.\\n\\nMy mother didn\\'t look at me.  She started the car.\\n\\nThen she said, as we glided under the cool, deep-sea shade of the elms,\\n\\'Doctor Gordon doesn\\'t think you\\'ve improved at all.  He thinks you\\nshould have some shock treatments at his private hospital in Walton.\\'\\n\\nI felt a sharp stab of curiosity, as if I had just read a terrible\\nnewspaper headline about somebody else.\\n\\n\\'Does he mean live there?\\'\\n\\n\\'No,\\' my mother said, and her chin quivered.\\n\\nI thought she must be lying.\\n\\n\\'You tell me the truth,\\' I said, \\'or I\\'ll never speak to you again.\\'\\n\\n\\'Don\\'t I _al_ways tell you the truth?\\' my mother said, and burst into\\ntears.\\n\\n\\nSUICIDE SAVED FROM SEVEN-STOREY LEDGE!\\n\\n_After two hours on a narrow ledge seven storeys above a concrete\\nparking lot and gathered crowds, Mr George Pollucci let himself be\\nhelped to safety through a nearby window by Sgt. Will Kilmartin of the\\nCharles Street police force._\\n\\n\\nI cracked open a peanut from the ten cent bag I had bought to feed the\\npigeons, and ate it.  It tasted dead, like a bit of old tree bark.\\n\\nI brought the newspaper close up to my eyes to get a better view of\\nGeorge Pollucci\\'s face, spotlighted like a three-quarter moon against a\\nvague background of brick and black sky.  I felt he had something\\nimportant to tell me, and that whatever it was might just be written on\\nhis face.\\n\\nBut the smudgy crags of George Pollucci\\'s features melted away as I\\npeered at them, and resolved themselves into a regular pattern of dark\\nand light and medium grey dots.\\n\\nThe inky black newspaper paragraph didn\\'t tell why Mr Pollucci was on\\nthe ledge, or what Sgt. Kilmartin did to him when he finally got him in\\nthrough the window.\\n\\nThe trouble about jumping was that if you didn\\'t pick the right number\\nof storeys, you might still be alive when you hit bottom.  I thought\\nseven storeys must be a safe distance.\\n\\nI folded the paper and wedged it between the slats of the park bench.\\nIt was what my mother called a scandal sheet, full of the local murders\\nand suicides and beatings and robbings, and just about every page had a\\nhalf-naked lady on it with her breasts surging over the edge of her\\ndress and her legs arranged so you could see to her stocking tops.\\n\\nI didn\\'t know why I had never bought any of these papers before.  They\\nwere the only things I could read.  The little paragraphs between the\\npictures ended before the letters had a chance to get cocky and wiggle\\nabout.  At home, all I ever saw was the _Christian Science Monitor_,\\nwhich appeared on the doorstep at five o\\'clock every day but Sunday and\\ntreated suicides and sex crimes and aeroplane crashes as if they didn\\'t\\nhappen.\\n\\nA big white swan full of little children approached my bench, then\\nturned round a bosky islet covered with ducks and paddled back under\\nthe dark arch of the bridge.  Everything I looked at seemed bright and\\nextremely tiny.\\n\\nI saw, as if through the keyhole of a door I couldn\\'t open, myself and\\nmy younger brother, knee-high and holding rabbit-eared balloons, climb\\naboard a swanboat and fight for a seat at the edge, over the\\npeanut-shell-paved water.  My mouth tasted of cleanness and peppermint.\\nIf we were good at the dentist\\'s, my mother always bought us a swanboat\\nride.\\n\\nI circled the Public Garden--over the bridge and under the blue-green\\nmonuments, past the American flag flower-bed and the entrance where you\\ncould have your picture taken in an orange-and-white striped canvas\\nbooth for twenty-five cents--reading the names of the trees.\\n\\nMy favourite tree was the Weeping Scholar Tree.  I thought it must come\\nfrom Japan.  They understood things of the spirit in Japan.\\n\\nThey disembowelled themselves when anything went wrong.\\n\\nI tried to imagine how they would go about it.  They must have an\\nextremely sharp knife.  No, probably two extremely sharp knives.  Then\\nthey would sit down, cross-legged, a knife in either hand.  Then they\\nwould cross their hands and point a knife at each side of their\\nstomach.  They would have to be naked, or the knife would get stuck in\\ntheir clothes.\\n\\nThen in one quick flash, before they had time to think twice, they\\nwould jab the knives in and zip them round, one on the upper crescent\\nand one on the lower crescent, making a full circle.  Then their\\nstomach skin would come loose, like a plate, and their insides would\\nfall out, and they would die.\\n\\nIt must take a lot of courage to die like that.\\n\\nMy trouble was I hated the sight of blood.\\n\\nI thought I might stay in the park all night.\\n\\nThe next morning Dodo Conway was driving my mother and me to Walton,\\nand if I was to run away before it was too late, now was the time.  I\\nlooked in my pocket-book and counted out a dollar bill and seventy-nine\\ncents in dimes and nickels and pennies.\\n\\nI had no idea how much it would cost to get to Chicago, and I didn\\'t\\ndare go to the bank and draw out all my money, because I thought Doctor\\nGordon might well have warned the bank clerk to intercept me if I made\\nany obvious move.\\n\\nHitch-hiking occurred to me, but I had no idea which of all the routes\\nout of Boston led to Chicago.  It\\'s easy enough to find directions on a\\nmap, but I had very little knowledge of directions when I was smack in\\nthe middle of somewhere.  Every time I wanted to figure what was east\\nor what was west it seemed to be noon, or cloudy, which was no help at\\nall, or night-time, and except for the Big Dipper and Cassiopeia\\'s\\nChair, I was hopeless at stars, a failing which always disheartened\\nBuddy Willard.\\n\\nI decided to walk to the bus terminal and inquire about the fares to\\nChicago.  Then I might go to the bank and withdraw precisely that\\namount, which would not cause so much suspicion.\\n\\nI had just strolled in through the glass doors of the terminal and was\\nbrowsing over the rack of coloured tour leaflets and schedules, when I\\nrealized that the bank in my home town would be closed, as it was\\nalready mid-afternoon, and I couldn\\'t get any money out till the next\\nday.\\n\\nMy appointment at Walton was for ten o\\'clock.\\n\\nAt that moment, the loudspeaker crackled into life and started\\nannouncing the stops of a bus getting ready to leave in the parking lot\\noutside.  The voice on the loudspeaker went bockle bockle bockle, the\\nway they do, so you can\\'t understand a word, and then, in the middle of\\nall the static, I heard a familiar name clear as _A_ on the piano in\\nthe middle of all the tuning instruments of an orchestra.\\n\\nIt was a stop two blocks from my house.\\n\\nI hurried out into the hot, dusty, end-of-July afternoon, sweating and\\nsandy-mouthed, as if late for a difficult interview, and boarded the\\nred bus, whose motor was already running.\\n\\nI handed my fare to the driver, and silently, on gloved hinges, the\\ndoor folded shut at my back.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter Twelve\\n\\nDoctor Gordon\\'s private hospital crowned a grassy rise at the end of a\\nlong, secluded drive that had been whitened with broken quahog shells.\\nThe yellow clapboard walls of the large house, with its encircling\\nveranda, gleamed in the sun, but no people strolled on the green dome\\nof the lawn.\\n\\nAs my mother and I approached the summer heat bore down on us, and a\\ncicada started up, like an aerial lawnmower, in the heart of a copper\\nbeech tree at the back.  The sound of the cicada only served to\\nunderline the enormous silence.\\n\\nA nurse met us at the door.\\n\\n\\'Will you wait in the living-room, please.  Doctor Gordon will be with\\nyou presently.\\'\\n\\nWhat bothered me was that everything about the house seemed normal,\\nalthough I knew it must be chock-full of crazy people.  There were no\\nbars on the windows that I could see, and no wild or disquieting\\nnoises.  Sunlight measured itself out in regular oblongs on the shabby,\\nbut soft red carpets, and a whiff of fresh-cut grass sweetened the air.\\n\\nI paused in the doorway of the living-room.\\n\\nFor a minute I thought it was the replica of a lounge in a guest house\\nI visited once on an island off the coast of Maine.  The French doors\\nlet in a dazzle of white light, a grand piano ruled the far corner of\\nthe room, and people in summer clothes were sitting about at card\\ntables and in the lopsided wicker armchairs one so often finds at\\ndown-at-heel seaside resorts.\\n\\nThen I realized that none of the people were moving.\\n\\nI focused more closely, trying to pry some clue from their stiff\\npostures.  I made out men and women, and boys and girls who must be as\\nyoung as I, but there was a uniformity to their faces, as if they had\\nlain for a long time on a shelf, out of the sunlight, under siftings of\\npale, fine dust.\\n\\nThen I saw that some of the people were indeed moving, but with such\\nsmall, birdlike gestures I had not at first discerned them.\\n\\nA grey-faced man was counting out a deck of cards, one, two, three,\\nfour...  I thought he must be seeing if it was a full pack, but when he\\nhad finished counting, he started over again.  Next to him, a fat lady\\nplayed with a string of wooden beads.  She drew all the beads up to one\\nend of the string.  Then click, click, click, she let them fall back on\\neach other.\\n\\nAt the piano, a young girl leafed through a few sheets of music, but\\nwhen she saw me looking at her, she ducked her head crossly and tore\\nthe sheets in half.\\n\\nMy mother touched my arm, and I followed her into the room.\\n\\nWe sat, without speaking, on a lumpy sofa that creaked each time one\\nstirred.\\n\\nThen my gaze slid over the people to the blaze of green beyond the\\ndiaphanous curtains, and I felt as if I were sitting in the window of\\nan enormous department store.  The figures around me weren\\'t people,\\nbut shop dummies, painted to resemble people and propped up in\\nattitudes counterfeiting life.\\n\\n\\nI climbed after Doctor Gordon\\'s dark-jacketed back.  Downstairs, in the\\nhall, I had tried to ask him what the shock treatment would be like,\\nbut when I opened my mouth no words came out, my eyes only widened and\\nstared at the smiling, familiar face that floated before me like a\\nplate full of assurances.\\n\\nAt the top of the stairs, the garnet-coloured carpet stopped.  A plain,\\nbrown linoleum, tacked to the floor, took its place, and extended down\\na corridor lined with shut white doors.  As I followed Doctor Gordon, a\\ndoor opened somewhere in the distance, and I heard a woman shouting.\\n\\nAll at once a nurse popped around the corner of the corridor ahead of\\nus leading a woman in a blue bathrobe with shaggy, waist-length hair.\\nDoctor Gordon stepped back, and I flattened against the wall.\\n\\nAs the woman was dragged by, waving her arms and struggling in the grip\\nof the nurse, she was saying, \\'I\\'m going to jump out of the window, I\\'m\\ngoing to jump out of the window, I\\'m going to jump out of the window.\\'\\n\\nDumpy and muscular in her smudge-fronted uniform, the wall-eyed nurse\\nwore such thick spectacles that four eyes peered out at me from behind\\nthe round, twin panes of glass.  I was trying to tell which eyes were\\nthe real eyes and which the false eyes, and which of the real eyes was\\nthe wall-eye and which the straight eye, when she brought her face up\\nto mine with a large, conspiratorial grin and hissed, as if to reassure\\nme, \\'She thinks she\\'s going to jump out the window but she can\\'t jump\\nout the window because they\\'re all barred!\\'\\n\\nAnd as Doctor Gordon led me into a bare room at the back of the house,\\nI saw that the windows in that part were indeed barred, and that the\\nroom door and the closet door and the drawers of the bureau and\\neverything that opened and shut was fitted with a keyhole so it could\\nbe locked up.\\n\\nI lay down on the bed.\\n\\nThe wall-eyed nurse came back.  She unclasped my watch and dropped it\\nin her pocket.  Then she started tweaking the hairpins from my hair.\\n\\nDoctor Gordon was unlocking the closet.  He dragged out a table on\\nwheels with a machine on it and rolled it behind the head of the bed.\\nThe nurse started swabbing my temples with a smelly grease.\\n\\nAs she leaned over to reach the side of my head nearest the wall, her\\nfat breast muffled my face like a cloud or a pillow.  A vague,\\nmedicinal stench emanated from her flesh.\\n\\n\\'Don\\'t worry,\\' the nurse grinned down at me.  \\'Their first time\\neverybody\\'s scared to death.\\'\\n\\nI tried to smile, but my skin had gone stiff, like parchment.\\n\\nDoctor Gordon was fitting two metal plates on either side of my head.\\nHe buckled them into place with a strap that dented my forehead, and\\ngave me a wire to bite.\\n\\nI shut my eyes.\\n\\nThere was a brief silence, like an indrawn breath.\\n\\nThen something bent down and took hold of me and shook me like the end\\nof the world.  Whee-ee-ee-ee-ee, it shrilled, through an air crackling\\nwith blue light, and with each flash a great jolt drubbed me till I\\nthought my bones would break and the sap fly out of me like a split\\nplant.\\n\\nI wondered what terrible thing it was that I had done.\\n\\n\\nI was sitting in a wicker chair, holding a small cocktail glass of\\ntomato juice.  The watch had been replaced on my wrist, but it looked\\nodd.  Then I realized it had been fastened upside down.  I sensed the\\nunfamiliar positioning of the hairpins in my hair.\\n\\n\\'How do you feel?\\'\\n\\nAn old metal floor lamp surfaced in my mind.  One of the few relics of\\nmy father\\'s study, it was surmounted by a copper bell which held the\\nlight bulb, and from which a frayed, tiger-coloured cord ran down the\\nlength of the metal stand to a socket in the wall.\\n\\nOne day I\\'d decided to move this lamp from the side of my mother\\'s bed\\nto my desk at the other end of the room.  The cord would be long\\nenough, so I didn\\'t unplug it.  I closed both hands around the lamp and\\nthe fuzzy cord and gripped them tight.\\n\\nThen something leapt out of the lamp in a blue flash and shook me till\\nmy teeth rattled, and I tried to pull my hands off, but they were\\nstuck, and I screamed, or a scream was torn from my throat, for I\\ndidn\\'t recognize it, but heard it soar and quaver in the air like a\\nviolently disembodied spirit.\\n\\nThen my hands jerked free, and I fell back on to my mother\\'s bed.  A\\nsmall hole, blackened as if with pencil lead, pitted the centre of my\\nright palm.\\n\\n\\'How do you feel?\\'\\n\\n\\'All right.\\'\\n\\nBut I didn\\'t.  I felt terrible.\\n\\n\\'Which college did you say you went to?\\'\\n\\nI said what college it was.\\n\\n\\'Ah!\\'  Doctor Gordon\\'s face lighted with a slow, almost tropical smile.\\n\\'They had a WAC station up there, didn\\'t they, during the war?\\'\\n\\n\\nMy mother\\'s knuckles were bone-white, as if the skin had worn off them\\nin the hour of waiting.  She looked past me to Doctor Gordon, and he\\nmust have nodded, or smiled, because her face relaxed.\\n\\n\\'A few more shock treatments, Mrs Greenwood,\\' I heard Doctor Gordon\\nsay, \\'and I think you\\'ll notice a wonderful improvement.\\'\\n\\nThe girl was still sitting on the piano stool, the torn sheet of music\\nsplayed at her feet like a dead bird.  She stared at me, and I stared\\nback.  Her eyes narrowed.  She stuck out her tongue.\\n\\nMy mother was following Doctor Gordon to the door.  I lingered behind,\\nand when their backs were turned, I rounded on the girl and thumbed\\nboth ears at her.  She pulled her tongue in, and her face went stony.\\n\\nI walked out into the sun.\\n\\nPanther-like in a dapple of tree shadow, Dodo Conway\\'s black station\\nwagon lay in wait.\\n\\nThe station wagon had been ordered originally by a wealthy society\\nlady, black, without a speck of chrome, and with black leather\\nupholstery, but when it came, it depressed her.  It was the dead spit\\nof a hearse, she said, and everybody else thought so too, and nobody\\nwould buy it, so the Conways drove it home, cut-price, and saved\\nthemselves a couple of hundred dollars.\\n\\nSitting in the front seat, between Dodo and my mother, I felt dumb and\\nsubdued.  Every time I tried to concentrate, my mind glided off, like a\\nskater, into a large empty space, and pirouetted there, absently.\\n\\n\\'I\\'m through with that Doctor Gordon,\\' I said, after we had left Dodo\\nand her black wagon behind the pines.  \\'You can call him up and tell\\nhim I\\'m not coming next week.\\'\\n\\nMy mother smiled.  \\'I knew my baby wasn\\'t like that.\\'\\n\\nI looked at her.  \\'Like what?\\'\\n\\n\\'Like those awful people.  Those awful dead people at that hospital.\\'\\nShe paused.  \\'I knew you\\'d decide to be all right again.\\'\\n\\n\\n\\nSTARLET SUCCUMBS AFTER SIXTY-EIGHT HOUR COMA.\\n\\n\\nI felt in my pocket-book among the paper scraps and the compact and the\\npeanut shells and the dimes and nickels and the blue jiffy box\\ncontaining nineteen Gillette blades, till I unearthed the snapshot I\\'d\\nhad taken that afternoon in the orange-and-white striped booth.\\n\\nI brought it up next to the smudgy photograph of the dead girl.  It\\nmatched, mouth for mouth, nose for nose.  The only difference was the\\neyes.  The eyes in the snapshot were open, and those in the newspaper\\nphotograph were closed.  But I knew if the dead girl\\'s eyes were to be\\nthumbed wide, they would look out at me with the same dead, black,\\nvacant expression as the eyes in the snapshot.\\n\\nI stuffed the snapshot back in my pocket-book.\\n\\n\\'I will just sit here in the sun on this park bench five minutes more\\nby the clock on that building over there,\\' I told myself, \\'and then I\\nwill go somewhere and do it.\\'\\n\\nI summoned my little chorus of voices.\\n\\n_Doesn\\'t your work interest you, Esther?_\\n\\n_You know, Esther, you\\'ve got the perfect set-up of a true neurotic._\\n\\n_You\\'ll never get anywhere like that, you\\'ll never get anywhere like\\nthat, you\\'ll never get anywhere like that._\\n\\nOnce, on a hot summer night, I had spent an hour kissing a hairy,\\nape-shaped law student from Yale because I felt sorry for him, he was\\nso ugly.  When I had finished, he said, \\'I have you taped, baby.\\nYou\\'ll be a prude at forty.\\'\\n\\n\\'Factitious!\\' my creative writing professor at college scrawled on a\\nstory of mine called \\'The Big Weekend\\'.\\n\\nI hadn\\'t known what factitious meant, so I looked it up in the\\ndictionary.\\n\\nFactitious, artificial, sham.\\n\\n_You\\'ll never get anywhere like that._\\n\\nI hadn\\'t slept for twenty-one nights.\\n\\nI thought the most beautiful thing in the world must be shadow, the\\nmillion moving shapes and cul-de-sacs of shadow.  There was shadow in\\nbureau drawers and closets and suitcases, and shadow under houses and\\ntrees and stones, and shadow at the back of people\\'s eyes and smiles,\\nand shadow, miles and miles and miles of it, on the night side of the\\nearth.\\n\\nI looked down at the two flesh-coloured band-aids forming a cross on\\nthe calf of my right leg.\\n\\nThat morning I had made a start.\\n\\nI had locked myself in the bathroom, and run a tub full of warm water,\\nand taken out a Gillette blade.\\n\\nWhen they asked some old Roman philosopher or other how he wanted to\\ndie, he said he would open his veins in a warm bath.  I thought it\\nwould be easy, lying in the tub and seeing the redness flower from my\\nwrists, flush after flush through the clear water, till I sank to sleep\\nunder a surface gaudy as poppies.\\n\\nBut when it came right down to it, the skin of my wrist looked so white\\nand defenceless that I couldn\\'t do it.  It was as if what I wanted to\\nkill wasn\\'t in that skin or the thin blue pulse that jumped under my\\nthumb, but somewhere else, deeper, more secret, and a whole lot harder\\nto get at.\\n\\nIt would take two motions.  One wrist, then the other wrist.  Three\\nmotions, if you counted changing the razor from hand to hand.  Then I\\nwould step into the tub and lie down.\\n\\nI moved in front of the medicine cabinet.  If I looked in the mirror\\nwhile I did it, it would be like watching somebody else, in a book or a\\nplay.\\n\\nBut the person in the mirror was paralysed and too stupid to do a thing.\\n\\nThen I thought, maybe I ought to spill a little blood for practice, so\\nI sat on the edge of the tub and crossed my right ankle over my left\\nknee.  Then I lifted my right hand with the razor and let it drop of\\nits own weight, like a guillotine, on to the calf of my leg.\\n\\nI felt nothing.  Then I felt a small, deep thrill, and a bright seam of\\nred welled up at the lip of the slash.  The blood gathered darkly, like\\nfruit, and rolled down my ankle into the cup of my black patent leather\\nshoe.\\n\\nI thought of getting into the tub then, but I realized my dallying had\\nused up the better part of the morning, and that my mother would\\nprobably come home and find me before I was done.\\n\\nSo I bandaged the cut, packed up my Gillette blades and caught the\\neleven-thirty bus to Boston.\\n\\n\\n\\'Sorry, baby, there\\'s no subway to the Deer Island Prison, it\\'s on a\\nniland.\\'\\n\\n\\'No, it\\'s not on an island, it used to be on an island, but they filled\\nup the water with dirt and now it joins on to the mainland.\\'\\n\\n\\'There\\'s no subway.\\'\\n\\n\\'I\\'ve got to get there.\\'\\n\\n\\'Hey,\\' the fat man in the ticket booth peered at me through the\\ngrating, \\'don\\'t cry.  Who you got there, honey, some relative?\\'\\n\\nPeople shoved and bumped by me in the artificially lit dark, hurrying\\nafter the trains that rumbled in and out of the intestinal tunnels\\nunder Scollay Square.  I could feel the tears start to spurt from the\\nscrewed-up nozzles of my eyes.\\n\\n\\'It\\'s my _fa_ther.\\'\\n\\nThe fat man consulted a diagram on the wall of his booth.  \\'Here\\'s how\\nyou do,\\' he said, \\'you take a car from that track over there and get\\noff at Orient Heights and then hop a bus with The Point on it.\\'  He\\nbeamed at me.  \\'It\\'ll run you straight to the prison gate.\\'\\n\\n\\n\\'Hey you!\\'  A young fellow in a blue uniform waved from the hut.\\n\\nI waved back and kept on going.\\n\\n\\'Hey you!\\'\\n\\nI stopped, and walked slowly over to the hut that perched like a\\ncircular living-room on the waste of sands.\\n\\n\\'Hey, you can\\'t go any further.  That\\'s prison property, no trespassers\\nallowed.\\'\\n\\n\\'I thought you could go anyplace along the beach,\\' I said.  \\'So long as\\nyou stayed under the tideline.\\'\\n\\nThe fellow thought a minute.\\n\\nThen he said, \\'Not this beach.\\'\\n\\nHe had a pleasant, fresh face.\\n\\n\\'You\\'ve a nice place here,\\' I said.  \\'It\\'s like a little house.\\'\\n\\nHe glanced back into the room, with its braided rug and chintz\\ncurtains.  He smiled.\\n\\n\\'We even got a coffee pot.\\'\\n\\n\\'I used to live near here.\\'\\n\\n\\'No kidding.  I was born and brought up in this town myself.\\'\\n\\nI looked across the sands to the parking lot and the barred gate, and\\npast the barred gate to the narrow road, lapped by the ocean on both\\nsides, that led out to the one-time island.\\n\\nThe red brick buildings of the prison looked friendly, like the\\nbuildings of a seaside college.  On a green hump of lawn to the left, I\\ncould see small white spots and slightly larger pink spots moving\\nabout.  I asked the guard what they were, and he said, \\'Them\\'s pigs \\'n\\'\\nchickens.\\'\\n\\nI was thinking that if I\\'d had the sense to go on living in that old\\ntown I might just have met this prison guard in school and married him\\nand had a parcel of kids by now.  It would be nice, living by the sea\\nwith piles of little kids and pigs and chickens, wearing what my\\ngrandmother called wash dresses, and sitting about in some kitchen with\\nbright linoleum and fat arms, drinking pots of coffee.\\n\\n\\'How do you get into that prison?\\'\\n\\n\\'You get a pass.\\'\\n\\n\\'No, how do you get _locked_ in?\\'\\n\\n\\'Oh,\\' the guard laughed, \\'you steal a car, you rob a store.\\'\\n\\n\\'You got any murderers in there?\\'\\n\\n\\'No.  Murderers go to a big state place.\\'\\n\\n\\'Who else is in there?\\'\\n\\n\\'Well, the first day of winter we get these old bums out of Boston.\\nThey heave a brick through a window, and then they get picked up and\\nspend the winter out of the cold, with TV and plenty to eat, and\\nbasketball games on the weekend.\\'\\n\\n\\'That\\'s nice.\\'\\n\\n\\'Nice if you like it,\\' said the guard.\\n\\nI said good-bye and started to move off, glancing back over my shoulder\\nonly once.  The guard still stood in the doorway of his observation\\nbooth, and when I turned he lifted his arm in a salute.\\n\\n\\nThe log I sat on was lead-heavy and smelled of tar.  Under the stout,\\ngrey cylinder of the water tower on its commanding hill, the sandbar\\ncurved out into the sea.  At high tide the bar completely submerged\\nitself.\\n\\nI remembered that sandbar well.  It harboured, in the crook of its\\ninner curve, a particular shell that could be found nowhere else on the\\nbeach.\\n\\nThe shell was thick, smooth, big as a thumb joint, and usually white,\\nalthough sometimes pink or peach-coloured.  It resembled a sort of\\nmodest conch.\\n\\n\\'Mummy, that girl\\'s _still_ sitting there.\\'\\n\\nI looked up, idly, and saw a small, sandy child being dragged up from\\nthe sea\\'s edge by a skinny, bird-eyed woman in red shorts and a\\nred-and-white polka-dotted halter.\\n\\nI hadn\\'t counted on the beach being overrun with summer people.  In the\\nten years of my absence, fancy blue and pink and pale green shanties\\nhad sprung up on the flat sands of the Point like a crop of tasteless\\nmushrooms, and the silver aeroplanes and cigar-shaped blimps had given\\nway to jets that scoured the rooftops in their loud onrush from the\\nairport across the bay.\\n\\nI was the only girl on the beach in a skirt and high heels, and it\\noccurred to me I must stand out.  I had removed my patent leather shoes\\nafter a while, for they foundered badly in the sand.  It pleased me to\\nthink they would be perched there on the silver log, pointing out to\\nsea, like a sort of soul-compass, after I was dead.\\n\\nI fingered the box of razors in my pocket-book.\\n\\nThen I thought how stupid I was.  I had the razors, but no warm bath.\\n\\nI considered renting a room.  There must be a boarding house among all\\nthose summer places.  But I had no luggage.  That would create\\nsuspicion.  Besides, in a boarding house other people are always\\nwanting to use the bathroom.  I\\'d hardly have time to do it and step\\ninto the tub when somebody would be pounding at the door.\\n\\nThe gulls on their wooden stilts at the tip of the bar miaowed like\\ncats.  Then they flapped up, one by one, in their ash-coloured jackets,\\ncircling my head and crying.\\n\\n\\n\\'Say, lady, you better not sit out here, the tide\\'s coming in.\\'\\n\\nThe small boy squatted a few feet away.  He picked up a round purple\\nstone and lobbed it into the water.  The water swallowed it with a\\nresonant plop.  Then he scrabbled around, and I heard the dry stones\\nclank together like money.\\n\\nHe skimmed a flat stone over the dull green surface, and it skipped\\nseven times before it sliced out of sight.\\n\\n\\'Why don\\'t you go home?\\' I said.\\n\\nThe boy skipped another, heavier stone.  It sank after the second\\nbounce.\\n\\n\\'Don\\'t want to.\\'\\n\\n\\'Your mother\\'s looking for you.\\'\\n\\n\\'She is not.\\'  He sounded worried.\\n\\n\\'If you go home, I\\'ll give you some candy.\\'\\n\\nThe boy hitched closer.  \\'What kind?\\'\\n\\nBut I knew without looking into my pocket-book that all I had was\\npeanut shells.\\n\\n\\'I\\'ll give you some money to buy some candy.\\'\\n\\n\\'Ar-_thur_!\\'\\n\\nA woman was indeed coming out on the sandbar, slipping and no doubt\\ncursing to herself, for her lips went up and down between her clear,\\nperemptory calls.\\n\\n\\'Ar-_thur_!\\'\\n\\nShe shaded her eyes with one hand, as if this helped her discern us\\nthrough the thickening sea dusk.\\n\\nI could sense the boy\\'s interest dwindle as the pull of his mother\\nincreased.  He began to pretend he didn\\'t know me.  He kicked over a\\nfew stones, as if searching for something, and edged off.\\n\\nI shivered.\\n\\nThe stones lay lumpish and cold under my bare feet.  I thought\\nlongingly of the black shoes on the beach.  A wave drew back, like a\\nhand, then advanced and touched my foot.\\n\\nThe drench seemed to come off the sea floor itself, where blind white\\nfish ferried themselves by their own light through the great polar\\ncold.  I saw sharks\\' teeth and whales\\' earbones littered about down\\nthere like gravestones.\\n\\nI waited, as if the sea could make my decision for me.\\n\\nA second wave collapsed over my feet, lipped with white froth, and the\\nchill gripped my ankles with a mortal ache.\\n\\nMy flesh winced, in cowardice, from such a death.\\n\\nI picked up my pocket-book and started back over the cold stones to\\nwhere my shoes kept their vigil in the violet light.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter Thirteen\\n\\n\\'Of course his mother killed him.\\'\\n\\nI looked at the mouth of the boy Jody had wanted me to meet.  His lips\\nwere thick and pink and a baby face nestled under the silk of\\nwhite-blond hair.  His name was Cal, which I thought must be short for\\nsomething, but I couldn\\'t think what it would be short for, unless it\\nwas California.\\n\\n\\'How can you be sure she killed him?\\' I said.\\n\\nCal was supposed to be very intelligent, and Jody had said over the\\nphone that he was cute and I would like him.  I wondered, if I\\'d been\\nmy old self, if I would have liked him.\\n\\nIt was impossible to tell.\\n\\n\\'Well, first she says No no no, and then she says Yes.\\'\\n\\n\\'But then she says No no again.\\'\\n\\nCal and I lay side by side on an orange and green striped towel on a\\nmucky beach across the swamps from Lynn.  Jody and Mark, the boy she\\nwas pinned to, were swimming.  Cal hadn\\'t wanted to swim, he had wanted\\nto talk, and we were arguing about this play where a young man finds\\nout he has a brain disease, on account of his father fooling around\\nwith unclean women, and in the end his brain, which has been softening\\nall along, snaps completely, and his mother is debating whether to kill\\nhim or not.\\n\\nI had a suspicion that my mother had called Jody and begged her to ask\\nme out, so I wouldn\\'t sit around in my room all day with the shades\\ndrawn.  I didn\\'t want to go at first, because I thought Jody would\\nnotice the change in me, and that anybody with half an eye would see I\\ndidn\\'t have a brain in my head.\\n\\nBut all during the drive north, and then east, Jody had joked and\\nlaughed and chattered and not seemed to mind that I only said, \\'My\\' or\\n\\'Gosh\\' or \\'You don\\'t say\\'.\\n\\nWe browned hotdogs on the public grills at the beach, and by watching\\nJody and Mark and Cal very carefully I managed to cook my hotdog just\\nthe right amount of time and didn\\'t burn it or drop it into the fire,\\nthe way I was afraid of doing.  Then, when nobody was looking, I buried\\nit in the sand.\\n\\nAfter we ate, Jody and Mark ran down to the water hand-in-hand, and I\\nlay back, staring into the sky, while Cal went on and on about this\\nplay.\\n\\nThe only reason I remembered this play was because it had a mad person\\nin it, and everything I had ever read about mad people stuck in my\\nmind, while everything else flew out.\\n\\n\\'But it\\'s the Yes that matters,\\' Cal said.  \\'It\\'s the Yes she\\'ll come\\nback to in the end.\\'\\n\\nI lifted my head and squinted out at the bright blue plate of the\\nsea--a bright blue plate with a dirty rim.  A big round grey rock, like\\nthe upper half of an egg, poked out of the water about a mile from the\\nstony headland.\\n\\n\\'What was she going to kill him with?  I forget.\\'\\n\\nI hadn\\'t forgotten.  I remembered perfectly well, but I wanted to hear\\nwhat Cal would say.\\n\\n\\'Morphia powders.\\'\\n\\n\\'Do you suppose they have morphia powders in America?\\'\\n\\nCal considered a minute.  Then he said, \\'I wouldn\\'t think so.  They\\nsound awfully old-fashioned.\\'\\n\\nI rolled over on to my stomach and squinted at the view in the other\\ndirection, towards Lynn.  A glassy haze rippled up from the fires in\\nthe grills and the heat on the road, and through the haze, as through a\\ncurtain of clear water, I could make out a smudgy skyline of gas tanks\\nand factory stacks and derricks and bridges.\\n\\nIt looked one hell of a mess.\\n\\nI rolled on to my back again and made my voice casual.  \\'If you were\\ngoing to kill yourself, how would you do it?\\'\\n\\nCal seemed pleased.  \\'I\\'ve often thought of that.  I\\'d blow my brains\\nout with a gun.\\'\\n\\nI was disappointed.  It was just like a man to do it with a gun.  A fat\\nchance I had of laying my hands on a gun.  And even if I did, I\\nwouldn\\'t have a clue as to what part of me to shoot at.\\n\\nI\\'d already read in the papers about people who\\'d tried to shoot\\nthemselves, only they ended up shooting an important nerve and getting\\nparalysed, or blasting their face off, but being saved, by surgeons and\\na sort of miracle, from dying outright.\\n\\nThe risks of a gun seemed great.\\n\\n\\'What kind of a gun?\\'\\n\\n\\'My father\\'s shotgun.  He keeps it loaded.  I\\'d just have to walk into\\nhis study one day and,\\' Cal pointed a finger to his temple and made a\\ncomical, screwed-up face, \\'click!\\'  He widened his pale grey eyes and\\nlooked at me.\\n\\n\\'Does your father happen to live near Boston?\\' I asked idly.\\n\\n\\'Nope.  In Clacton-on-Sea.  He\\'s English.\\'\\n\\nJody and Mark ran up hand-in-hand, dripping and shaking off water drops\\nlike two loving puppies.  I thought there would be too many people, so\\nI stood up and pretended to yawn.\\n\\n\\'I guess I\\'ll go for a swim.\\'\\n\\nBeing with Jody and Mark and Cal was beginning to weigh on my nerves,\\nlike a dull wooden block on the strings of a piano.  I was afraid that\\nat any moment my control would snap, and I would start babbling about\\nhow I couldn\\'t read and couldn\\'t write and how I must be just about the\\nonly person who had stayed awake for a solid month without dropping\\ndead of exhaustion.\\n\\nA smoke seemed to be going up from my nerves like the smoke from the\\ngrills and the sun-saturated road.  The whole landscape--beach and\\nheadland and sea and rock--quavered in front of my eyes like a stage\\nbackcloth.\\n\\nI wondered at what point in space the silly, sham blue of the sky\\nturned black.\\n\\n\\'You swim too, Cal.\\'\\n\\nJody gave Cal a playful little push.\\n\\n\\'Ohhh,\\' Cal hid his face in the towel.  \\'It\\'s too cold.\\'\\n\\nI started to walk towards the water.\\n\\nSomehow, in the broad, shadowless light of noon, the water looked\\namiable and welcoming.\\n\\nI thought drowning must be the kindest way to die, and burning the\\nworst.  Some of those babies in the jars that Buddy Willard showed me\\nhad gills, he said.  They went through a stage where they were just\\nlike fish.\\n\\nA little, rubbishy wavelet, full of candy wrappers and orange peel and\\nseaweed, folded over my foot.\\n\\nI heard the sand thud behind me, and Cal came up.\\n\\n\\'Let\\'s swim to that rock out there.\\'  I pointed at it.\\n\\n\\'Are you crazy?  That\\'s a mile out.\\'\\n\\n\\'What are you?\\' I said.  \\'Chicken?\\'\\n\\nCal took me by the elbow and jostled me into the water.  When we were\\nwaist high, he pushed me under.  I surfaced, splashing, my eyes seared\\nwith salt.  Underneath, the water was green and semi-opaque as a hunk\\nof quartz.\\n\\nI started to swim, a modified dogpaddle, keeping my face towards the\\nrock.  Cal did a slow crawl.  After a while he put his head up and\\ntreaded water.\\n\\n\\'Can\\'t make it.\\'  He was panting heavily.\\n\\n\\'Okay.  You go back.\\'\\n\\nI thought I would swim out until I was too tired to swim back.  As I\\npaddled on, my heartbeat boomed like a dull motor in my ears.\\n\\nI am I am I am.\\n\\n\\nThat morning I had tried to hang myself.\\n\\nI had taken the silk cord of my mother\\'s yellow bathrobe as soon as she\\nleft for work, and, in the amber shade of the bedroom, fashioned it\\ninto a knot that slipped up and down on itself.  It took me a long time\\nto do this, because I was poor at knots and had no idea how to make a\\nproper one.\\n\\nThen I hunted around for a place to attach the rope.\\n\\nThe trouble was, our house had the wrong kind of ceilings.  The\\nceilings were low, white and smoothly plastered, without a light\\nfixture or a wood beam in sight.  I thought with longing of the house\\nmy grandmother had before she sold it to come and live with us, and\\nthen with my Aunt Libby.\\n\\nMy grandmother\\'s house was built in the fine, nineteenth-century style,\\nwith lofty rooms and sturdy chandelier brackets and high closets with\\nstout rails across them, and an attic where nobody ever went, full of\\ntrunks and parrot cages and dressmaker\\'s dummies and overhead beams\\nthick as a ship\\'s timbers.\\n\\nBut it was an old house, and she\\'d sold it, and I didn\\'t know anybody\\nelse with a house like that.\\n\\nAfter a discouraging time of walking about with the silk cord dangling\\nfrom my neck like a yellow cat\\'s tail and finding no place to fasten\\nit, I sat on the edge of my mother\\'s bed and tried pulling the cord\\ntight.\\n\\nBut each time I would get the cord so tight I could feel a rushing in\\nmy ears and a flush of blood in my face, my hands would weaken and let\\ngo, and I would be all right again.\\n\\nThen I saw that my body had all sorts of little tricks, such as making\\nmy hands go limp at the crucial second, which would save it, time and\\nagain, whereas if I had the whole say, I would be dead in a flash.\\n\\nI would simply have to ambush it with whatever sense I had left, or it\\nwould trap me in its stupid cage for fifty years without any sense at\\nall.  And when people found out my mind had gone, as they would have\\nto, sooner or later, in spite of my mother\\'s guarded tongue, they would\\npersuade her to put me into an asylum where I could be cured.\\n\\nOnly my case was incurable.\\n\\nI had bought a few paperbacks on abnormal psychology at the drug store\\nand compared my symptoms with the symptoms in the books, and sure\\nenough, my symptoms tallied with the most hopeless cases.\\n\\nThe only thing I could read, beside the scandal sheets, were these\\nabnormal psychology books.  It was as if some slim opening had been\\nleft, so I could learn all I needed to know about my case to end it in\\nthe proper way.\\n\\nI wondered, after the hanging fiasco, if I shouldn\\'t just give it up\\nand turn myself over to the doctors, but then I remembered Doctor\\nGordon and his private shock machine.  Once I was locked up they could\\nuse that on me all the time.\\n\\nAnd I thought of how my mother and brother and friends would visit me,\\nday after day, hoping I would be better.  Then their visits would\\nslacken off, and they would give up hope.  They would grow old.  They\\nwould forget me.\\n\\nThey would be poor, too.\\n\\nThey would want me to have the best of care at first, so they would\\nsink all their money in a private hospital like Doctor Gordon\\'s.\\nFinally, when the money was used up, I would be moved to a state\\nhospital, with hundreds of people like me, in a big cage in the\\nbasement.\\n\\nThe more hopeless you were, the further away they hid you.\\n\\n\\nCal had turned around and was swimming in.\\n\\nAs I watched, he dragged himself slowly out of the neck-deep sea.\\nAgainst the khaki-coloured sand and the green shore wavelets, his body\\nwas bisected for a moment, like a white worm.  Then it crawled\\ncompletely out of the green and on to the khaki and lost itself among\\ndozens and dozens of other worms that were wriggling or just lolling\\nabout between the sea and the sky.\\n\\nI paddled my hands in the water and kicked my feet.  The egg-shaped\\nrock didn\\'t seem to be any nearer than it had been when Cal and I had\\nlooked at it from the shore.\\n\\nThen I saw it would be pointless to swim as far as the rock, because my\\nbody would take that excuse to climb out and lie in the sun, gathering\\nstrength to swim back.\\n\\nThe only thing to do was to drown myself then and there.\\n\\nSo I stopped.\\n\\nI brought my hands to my breast, ducked my head, and dived, using my\\nhands to push the water aside.  The water pressed in on my eardrums and\\non my heart.  I fanned myself down, but before I knew where I was, the\\nwater had spat me up into the sun, and the world was sparkling all\\nabout me like blue and green and yellow semi-precious stones.\\n\\nI dashed the water from my eyes.\\n\\nI was panting, as after a strenuous exertion, but floating, without\\neffort.\\n\\nI dived, and dived again, and each time popped up like a cork.\\n\\nThe grey rock mocked me, bobbing on the water easy as a lifebuoy.\\n\\nI knew when I was beaten.\\n\\nI turned back.\\n\\n\\nThe flowers nodded like bright, knowledgeable children as I trundled\\nthem down the hall.\\n\\nI felt silly in my sage-green volunteer\\'s uniform, and superfluous,\\nunlike the white-uniformed doctors and nurses, or even the\\nbrown-uniformed scrubwomen with their mops and their buckets of grimy\\nwater, who passed me without a word.\\n\\nIf I had been getting paid, no matter how little, I could at least\\ncount this a proper job, but all I got for a morning of pushing round\\nmagazines and candy and flowers was a free lunch.\\n\\nMy mother said the cure for thinking too much about yourself was\\nhelping somebody who was worse off than you, so Teresa had arranged for\\nme to sign on as a volunteer at our local hospital.  It was difficult\\nto be a volunteer at this hospital, because that\\'s what all the Junior\\nLeague women wanted to do, but luckily for me, a lot of them were away\\non vacation.\\n\\nI had hoped they would send me to a ward with some really gruesome\\ncases, who would see through my numb, dumb face to how I meant well,\\nand be grateful.  But the head of the volunteers, a society lady at our\\nchurch, took one look at me and said, \\'You\\'re on maternity.\\'\\n\\nSo I rode the elevator up three flights to the maternity ward and\\nreported to the head nurse.  She gave me the trolley of flowers.  I was\\nsupposed to put the right vases at the right beds in the right rooms.\\n\\nBut before I came to the door of the first room I noticed that a lot of\\nthe flowers were droopy and brown at the edges.  I thought it would be\\ndiscouraging for a woman who\\'d just had a baby to see somebody plonk\\ndown a big bouquet of dead flowers in front of her, so I steered the\\ntrolley to a wash-basin in an alcove in the hall and began to pick out\\nall the flowers that were dead.\\n\\nThen I picked out all those that were dying.\\n\\nThere was no waste-basket in sight, so I crumpled the flowers up and\\nlaid them in the deep white basin.  The basin felt cold as a tomb.  I\\nsmiled.  This must be how they laid the bodies away in the hospital\\nmorgue.  My gesture, in its small way, echoed the larger gesture of the\\ndoctors and nurses.\\n\\nI swung the door of the first room open and walked in, dragging my\\ntrolley.  A couple of nurses jumped up, and I had a confused impression\\nof shelves and medicine cabinets.\\n\\n\\'What do you want?\\' one of the nurses demanded sternly.  I couldn\\'t\\ntell one from the other, they all looked just alike.\\n\\n\\'I\\'m taking the flowers round.\\'\\n\\nThe nurse who had spoken put a hand on my shoulder and led me out of\\nthe room, manoeuvring the trolley with her free, expert hand.  She\\nflung open the swinging doors of the room next to that one and bowed me\\nin.  Then she disappeared.\\n\\nI could hear giggles in the distance till a door shut and cut them off.\\n\\nThere were six beds in the room, and each bed had a woman in it.  The\\nwomen were all sitting up and knitting or riffling through magazines or\\nputting their hair in pincurls and chattering like parrots in a parrot\\nhouse.\\n\\nI had thought they would be sleeping, or lying quiet and pale, so I\\ncould tiptoe round without any trouble and match the bed numbers to the\\nnumbers inked on adhesive tape on the vases, but before I had a chance\\nto get my bearings, a bright, jazzy blonde with a sharp, triangular\\nface beckoned to me.\\n\\nI approached her, leaving the trolley in the middle of the floor, but\\nthen she made an impatient gesture, and I saw she wanted me to bring\\nthe trolley too.\\n\\nI wheeled the trolley over to her bedside with a helpful smile.\\n\\n\\'Hey, where\\'s my larkspur?\\'  A large, flabby lady from across the ward\\nraked me with an eagle eye.\\n\\nThe sharp-faced blonde bent over the trolley.  \\'Here are my yellow\\nroses,\\' she said, \\'but they\\'re all mixed up with some lousy iris.\\'\\n\\nOther voices joined the voices of the first two women.  They sounded\\ncross and loud and full of complaint.\\n\\nI was opening my mouth to explain that I had thrown a bunch of dead\\nlarkspur in the sink, and that some of the vases I had weeded out\\nlooked skimpy, there were so few flowers left, so I had joined a few of\\nthe bouquets together to fill them out, when the swinging door flew\\nopen and a nurse stalked in to see what the commotion was.\\n\\n\\'Listen, nurse, I had this big bunch of larkspur Larry brought last\\nnight.\\'\\n\\n\\'She\\'s loused up my yellow roses.\\'\\n\\nUnbuttoning the green uniform as I ran, I stuffed it, in passing, into\\nthe washbasin with the rubbish of dead flowers.  Then I took the\\ndeserted side steps down to the street two at a time, without meeting\\nanother soul.\\n\\n\\n\\'Which way is the graveyard?\\'\\n\\nThe Italian in the black leather jacket stopped and pointed down an\\nalley behind the white Methodist church.  I remembered the Methodist\\nchurch.  I had been a Methodist for the first nine years of my life,\\nbefore my father died and we moved and turned Unitarian.\\n\\nMy mother had been a Catholic before she was a Methodist.  My\\ngrandmother and my grandfather and my Aunt Libby were all still\\nCatholics.  My Aunt Libby had broken away from the Catholic Church at\\nthe same time my mother did, but then she\\'d fallen in love with an\\nItalian Catholic, so she\\'d gone back again.\\n\\nLately I had considered going into the Catholic Church myself.  I knew\\nthat Catholics thought killing yourself was an awful sin.  But perhaps,\\nif this was so, they might have a good way to persuade me out of it.\\n\\nOf course, I didn\\'t believe in life after death or the virgin birth or\\nthe Inquisition or the infallibility of that little monkey-faced Pope\\nor anything, but I didn\\'t have to let the priest see this, I could just\\nconcentrate on my sin, and he would help me repent.\\n\\nThe only trouble was, Church, even the Catholic Church, didn\\'t take up\\nthe whole of your life.  No matter how much you knelt and prayed, you\\nstill had to eat three meals a day and have a job and live in the world.\\n\\nI thought I might see how long you had to be a Catholic before you\\nbecame a nun, so I asked my mother, thinking she\\'d know the best way to\\ngo about it.\\n\\nMy mother had laughed at me.  \\'Do you think they\\'ll take somebody like\\nyou, right off the bat?  Why you\\'ve got to know all these catechisms\\nand credos and believe in them, lock, stock and barrel.  A girl with\\nyour sense!\\'\\n\\nStill, I imagined myself going to some Boston priest--it would have to\\nbe Boston, because I didn\\'t want any priest in my home town to know I\\'d\\nthought of killing myself.  Priests were terrible gossips.\\n\\nI would be in black, with my dead white face, and I would throw myself\\nat this priest\\'s feet and say, \\'O Father, help me.\\'\\n\\nBut that was before people had begun to look at me in a funny way, like\\nthose nurses in the hospital.\\n\\nI was pretty sure the Catholics wouldn\\'t take in any crazy nuns.  My\\nAunt Libby\\'s husband had made a joke once, about a nun that a nunnery\\nsent to Teresa for a check-up.  This nun kept hearing harp notes in her\\nears and a voice saying over and over, \\'Alleluia!\\'  Only she wasn\\'t\\nsure, on being closely questioned, whether the voice was saying\\nAlleluia or Arizona.  The nun had been born in Arizona.  I think she\\nended up in some asylum.\\n\\nI tugged my black veil down to my chin and strode in through the\\nwrought-iron gates.  I thought it odd that in all the time my father\\nhad been buried in this graveyard, none of us had ever visited him.  My\\nmother hadn\\'t let us come to his funeral because we were only children\\nthen, and he had died in hospital, so the graveyard and even his death,\\nhad always seemed unreal to me.\\n\\nI had a great yearning, lately, to pay my father back for all the years\\nof neglect, and start tending his grave.  I had always been my father\\'s\\nfavourite, and it seemed fitting I should take on a mourning my mother\\nhad never bothered with.\\n\\nI thought that if my father hadn\\'t died, he would have taught me all\\nabout insects, which was his speciality at the university.  He would\\nalso have taught me German and Greek and Latin, which he knew, and\\nperhaps I would be a Lutheran.  My father had been a Lutheran in\\nWisconsin, but they were out of style in New England, so he had become\\na lapsed Lutheran and then, my mother said, a bitter atheist.\\n\\nThe graveyard disappointed me.  It lay at the outskirts of the town, on\\nlow ground, like a rubbish dump, and as I walked up and down the gravel\\npaths, I could smell the stagnant salt marshes in the distance.\\n\\nThe old part of the graveyard was all right, with its worn, flat stones\\nand lichen-bitten monuments, but I soon saw my father must be buried in\\nthe modern part with dates in the 1940\\'s.\\n\\nThe stones in the modern part were crude and cheap, and here and there\\na grave was rimmed with marble, like an oblong bathtub full of dirt,\\nand rusty metal containers stuck up about where the person\\'s navel\\nwould be, full of plastic flowers.\\n\\nA fine drizzle started drifting down from the grey sky, and I grew very\\ndepressed.\\n\\nI couldn\\'t find my father anywhere.\\n\\nLow, shaggy clouds scudded over that part of the horizon where the sea\\nlay, behind the marshes and the beach shanty settlements, and raindrops\\ndarkened the black mackintosh I had bought that morning.  A clammy\\ndampness sank through to my skin.\\n\\nI had asked the salesgirl, \\'Is it water-repellent?\\'\\n\\nAnd she had said, \\'No raincoat is ever water-_repellent_.  It\\'s\\nshowerproofed.\\'\\n\\nAnd when I asked her what showerproofed was, she told me I had better\\nbuy an umbrella.\\n\\nBut I hadn\\'t enough money for an umbrella.  What with bus fare in and\\nout of Boston and peanuts and newspapers and abnormal psychology books\\nand trips to my old home town by the sea, my New York fund was almost\\nexhausted.\\n\\nI had decided that when there was no more money in my bank account I\\nwould do it, and that morning I\\'d spent the last of it on the black\\nraincoat.\\n\\nThen I saw my father\\'s gravestone.\\n\\nIt was crowded right up by another gravestone, head to head, the way\\npeople are crowded in a charity ward when there isn\\'t enough space.\\nThe stone was of a molded pink marble, like tinned salmon, and all\\nthere was on it was my father\\'s name and, under it, two dates,\\nseparated by a little dash.\\n\\nAt the foot of the stone I arranged the rainy armful of azaleas I had\\npicked from a bush at the gateway of the graveyard.  Then my legs\\nfolded under me, and I sat down in the sopping grass.  I couldn\\'t\\nunderstand why I was crying so hard.\\n\\nThen I remembered that I had never cried for my father\\'s death.\\n\\nMy mother hadn\\'t cried either.  She had just smiled and said what a\\nmerciful thing it was for him he had died, because if he had lived he\\nwould have been crippled and an invalid for life, and he couldn\\'t have\\nstood that, he would rather have died than had that happen.\\n\\nI laid my face to the smooth face of the marble and howled my loss into\\nthe cold salt rain.\\n\\n\\nI knew just how to go about it.\\n\\nThe minute the car tyres crunched off down the drive and the sound of\\nthe motor faded, I jumped out of bed and hurried into my white blouse\\nand green figured skirt and black raincoat.  The raincoat felt damp\\nstill, from the day before, but that would soon cease to matter.\\n\\nI went downstairs and picked up a pale blue envelope from the\\ndining-room table and scrawled on the back, in large, painstaking\\nletters: _I am going for a long walk_.\\n\\nI propped the message where my mother would see it the minute she came\\nin.\\n\\nThen I laughed.\\n\\nI had forgotten the most important thing.\\n\\nI ran upstairs and dragged a chair into my mother\\'s closet.  Then I\\nclimbed up and reached for the small green strongbox on the top shelf.\\nI could have torn the metal cover off with my bare hands, the lock was\\nso feeble, but I wanted to do things in a calm, orderly way.\\n\\nI pulled out my mother\\'s upper right-hand bureau drawer and slipped the\\nblue jewellery box from its hiding-place under the scented Irish linen\\nhandkerchiefs.  I unpinned the little key from the dark velvet.  Then I\\nunlocked the strongbox and took out the bottle of new pills.  There\\nwere more than I had hoped.\\n\\nThere were at least fifty.\\n\\nIf I had waited until my mother doled them out to me, night by night,\\nit would have taken me fifty nights to save up enough.  And in fifty\\nnights, college would have opened, and my brother would have come back\\nfrom Germany, and it would be too late.\\n\\nI pinned the key back in the jewellery box among the clutter of\\ninexpensive chains and rings, put the jewellery box back in the drawer\\nunder the handkerchiefs, returned the strongbox to the closet shelf and\\nset the chair on the rug in the exact spot I had dragged it from.\\n\\nThen I went downstairs and into the kitchen.  I turned on the tap and\\npoured myself a tall glass of water.  Then I took the glass of water\\nand the bottle of pills and went down into the cellar.\\n\\nA dim, undersea light filtered through the slits of the cellar windows.\\nBehind the oil burner, a dark gap showed in the wall at about shoulder\\nheight and ran back under the breezeway, out of sight.  The breezeway\\nhad been added to the house after the cellar was dug, and built out\\nover this secret, earth-bottomed crevice.\\n\\nA few old, rotting fireplace logs blocked the hole mouth.  I shoved\\nthem back a bit.  Then I set the glass of water and the bottle of pills\\nside by side on the flat surface of one of the logs and started to\\nheave myself up.\\n\\nIt took me a good while to heft my body into the gap, but at last,\\nafter many tries, I managed it, and crouched at the mouth of the\\ndarkness, like a troll.\\n\\nThe earth seemed friendly under my bare feet, but cold.  I wondered how\\nlong it had been since this particular square of soil had seen the sun.\\n\\nThen, one after the other, I lugged the heavy, dust-covered logs across\\nthe hole mouth.  The dark felt thick as velvet.  I reached for the\\nglass and bottle, and, carefully, on my knees, with bent head, crawled\\nto the farthest wall.\\n\\nCobwebs touched my face with the softness of moths.  Wrapping my black\\ncoat round me like my own sweet shadow, I unscrewed the bottle of pills\\nand started taking them swiftly, between gulps of water, one by one by\\none.\\n\\nAt first nothing happened, but as I approached the bottom of the\\nbottle, red and blue lights began to flash before my eyes.  The bottle\\nslid from my fingers and I lay down.\\n\\nThe silence drew off, baring the pebbles and shells and all the tatty\\nwreckage of my life.  Then, at the rim of vision, it gathered itself,\\nand in one sweeping tide, rushed me to sleep.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter Fourteen\\n\\nIt was completely dark.\\n\\nI felt the darkness, but nothing else, and my head rose, feeling it,\\nlike the head of a worm.  Someone was moaning.  Then a great, hard\\nweight smashed against my cheek like a stone wall and the moaning\\nstopped.\\n\\nThe silence surged back, smoothing itself as black water smooths to its\\nold surface calm over a dropped stone.\\n\\nA cool wind rushed by.  I was being transported at enormous speed down\\na tunnel into the earth.  Then the wind stopped.  There was a rumbling,\\nas of many voices, protesting and disagreeing in the distance.  Then\\nthe voices stopped.\\n\\nA chisel cracked down on my eye, and a slit of light opened, like a\\nmouth or a wound, till the darkness clamped shut on it again.  I tried\\nto roll away from the direction of the light, but hands wrapped round\\nmy limbs like mummy bands, and I couldn\\'t move.\\n\\nI began to think I must be in an underground chamber, lit by blinding\\nlights, and that the chamber was full of people who for some reason\\nwere holding me down.\\n\\nThen the chisel struck again, and the light leapt into my head, and\\nthrough the thick, warm, furry dark, a voice cried,\\n\\n\\'Mother!\\'\\n\\n\\nAir breathed and played over my face.\\n\\nI felt the shape of a room around me, a big room with open windows.  A\\npillow moulded itself under my head, and my body floated, without\\npressure, between thin sheets.\\n\\nThen I felt warmth, like a hand on my face.  I must be lying in the\\nsun.  If I opened my eyes, I would see colours and shapes bending in\\nupon me like nurses.\\n\\nI opened my eyes.\\n\\nIt was completely dark.\\n\\nSomebody was breathing beside me.\\n\\n\\'I can\\'t see,\\' I said.\\n\\nA cheery voice spoke out of the dark.  \\'There are lots of blind people\\nin the world.  You\\'ll marry a nice blind man some day.\\'\\n\\n\\nThe man with the chisel had come back.\\n\\nWhy do you bother?\\' I said.  \\'It\\'s no use.\\'\\n\\n\\'You mustn\\'t talk like that.\\'  His fingers probed at the great, aching\\nboss over my left eye.  Then he loosened something, and a ragged gap of\\nlight appeared, like the hole in a wall.  A man\\'s head peered round the\\nedge of it.\\n\\n\\'Can you see me?\\'\\n\\n\\'Yes.\\'\\n\\n\\'Can you see anything else?\\'\\n\\nThen I remembered.  \\'I can\\'t see anything.\\'  The gap narrowed and went\\ndark.  \\'I\\'m blind.\\'\\n\\n\\'Nonsense!  Who told you that?\\'\\n\\n\\'The nurse.\\'\\n\\nThe man snorted.  He finished taping the bandage back over my eye.\\n\\'You are a very lucky girl.  Your sight is perfectly intact.\\'\\n\\n\\n\\'Somebody to see you.\\'\\n\\nThe nurse beamed and disappeared.\\n\\nMy mother came smiling round the foot of the bed.  She was wearing a\\ndress with purple cartwheels on it and she looked awful.\\n\\nA big tall boy followed her.  At first I couldn\\'t make out who it was,\\nbecause my eye only opened a short way, but then I saw it was my\\nbrother.\\n\\n\\'They said you wanted to see me.\\'\\n\\nMy mother perched on the edge of the bed and laid a hand on my leg.\\nShe looked loving and reproachful, and I wanted her to go away.\\n\\n\\'I didn\\'t think I said anything.\\'\\n\\n\\'They said you called for me.\\'  She seemed ready to cry.  Her face\\npuckered up and quivered like a pale jelly.\\n\\n\\'How are you?\\' my brother said.\\n\\nI looked my mother in the eye.\\n\\n\\'The same,\\' I said.\\n\\n\\n\\'You have a visitor.\\'\\n\\n\\'I don\\'t want a visitor.\\'\\n\\nThe nurse bustled out and whispered to somebody in the hall.  Then she\\ncame back.  \\'He\\'d very much like to see you.\\'\\n\\nI looked down at the yellow legs sticking out of the unfamiliar white\\nsilk pyjamas they had dressed me in.  The skin shook flabbily when I\\nmoved, as if there wasn\\'t a muscle in it, and it was covered with a\\nshort, thick stubble of black hair.\\n\\n\\'Who is it?\\'\\n\\n\\'Somebody you know.\\'\\n\\n\\'What\\'s his name?\\'\\n\\n\\'George Bakewell.\\'\\n\\n\\'I don\\'t know any George Bakewell.\\'\\n\\n\\'He says he knows you.\\'\\n\\nThen the nurse went out, and a very familiar boy came in and said,\\n\\'Mind if I sit on the edge of your bed?\\'\\n\\nHe was wearing a white coat, and I could see a stethoscope poking out\\nof his pocket.  I thought it must be somebody I knew dressed up as a\\ndoctor.\\n\\nI had meant to cover my legs if anybody came in, but now I saw it was\\ntoo late, so I let them stick out, just as they were, disgusting and\\nugly.\\n\\n\\'That\\'s me,\\' I thought.  \\'That\\'s what I am.\\'\\n\\n\\'You remember me, don\\'t you, Esther?\\'\\n\\nI squinted at the boy\\'s face through the crack of my good eye.  The\\nother eye hadn\\'t opened yet, but the eye doctor said it would be all\\nright in a few days.\\n\\nThe boy looked at me as if I were some exciting new zoo animal and he\\nwas about to burst out laughing.\\n\\n\\'You remember me, don\\'t you, Esther?\\'  He spoke slowly, the way one\\nspeaks to a dull child.  \\'I\\'m George Bakewell.  I go to your church.\\nYou dated my room-mate once at Amherst.\\'\\n\\nI thought I placed the boy\\'s face then.  It hovered dimly at the rim of\\nmemory--the sort of face to which I would never bother to attach a name.\\n\\n\\'What are you doing here?\\'\\n\\n\\'I\\'m houseman at this hospital.\\'\\n\\nHow could this George Bakewell have become a doctor so suddenly? I\\nwondered.  He didn\\'t really know me, either.  He just wanted to see\\nwhat a girl who was crazy enough to kill herself looked like.\\n\\nI turned my face to the wall.\\n\\n\\'Get out,\\' I said.  \\'Get the hell out and don\\'t come back.\\'\\n\\n\\n\\'I want to see a mirror.\\'\\n\\nThe nurse hummed busily as she opened one drawer after another,\\nstuffing the new underclothes and blouses and skirts and pyjamas my\\nmother had bought me into the black patent leather overnight case.\\n\\n\\'Why can\\'t I see a mirror?\\'\\n\\nI had been dressed in a sheath, striped grey and white, like mattress\\nticking, with a wide, shiny red belt, and they had propped me up in an\\narmchair.\\n\\n\\'Why can\\'t I?\\'\\n\\n\\'Because you better not.\\'  The nurse shut the lid of the overnight case\\nwith a little snap.\\n\\n\\'Why?\\'\\n\\n\\'Because you don\\'t look very pretty.\\'\\n\\n\\'Oh, just let me see.\\'\\n\\nThe nurse sighed and opened the top bureau drawer.  She took out a\\nlarge mirror in a wooden frame that matched the wood of the bureau and\\nhanded it to me.\\n\\nAt first I didn\\'t see what the trouble was.  It wasn\\'t a mirror at all,\\nbut a picture.\\n\\nYou couldn\\'t tell whether the person in the picture was a man or a\\nwoman, because their hair was shaved off and sprouted in bristly\\nchicken-feather tufts all over their head.  One side of the person\\'s\\nface was purple, and bulged out in a shapeless way, shading to green\\nalong the edges, and then to a sallow yellow.  The person\\'s mouth was\\npale brown, with a rose-coloured sore at either corner.\\n\\nThe most startling thing about the face was its supernatural\\nconglomeration of bright colours.\\n\\nI smiled.\\n\\nThe mouth in the mirror cracked into a grin.\\n\\nA minute after the crash another nurse ran in.  She took one look at\\nthe broken mirror, and at me, standing over the blind, white pieces,\\nand hustled the young nurse out of the room.\\n\\n\\'Didn\\'t I _tell_ you,\\' I could hear her say.\\n\\n\\'But I only...\\'\\n\\n\\'Didn\\'t I _tell_ you!\\'\\n\\nI listened with mild interest.  Anybody could drop a mirror.  I didn\\'t\\nsee why they should get so stirred up.\\n\\nThe other, older nurse came back into the room.  She stood there, arms\\nfolded, staring hard at me.\\n\\n\\'Seven years\\' bad luck.\\'\\n\\n\\'What?\\'\\n\\n\\'I said,\\' the nurse raised her voice, as if speaking to a deaf person,\\n\\'_seven years\\' bad luck_.\\'\\n\\nThe young nurse returned with a dustpan and brush and began to sweep up\\nthe glittery splinters.\\n\\n\\'That\\'s only a superstition,\\' I said then.\\n\\n\\'Huh!\\'  The second nurse addressed herself to the nurse on her hands\\nand knees as if I wasn\\'t there.  \\'At you-know-where they\\'ll take care\\nof _her_!\\'\\n\\n\\nFrom the back window of the ambulance I could see street after familiar\\nstreet funnelling off into a summery green distance.  My mother sat on\\none side of me, and my brother on the other.\\n\\nI had pretended I didn\\'t know why they were moving me from the hospital\\nin my home town to a city hospital, to see what they would say.\\n\\n\\'They want you to be in a special ward,\\' my mother said.  \\'They don\\'t\\nhave that sort of ward at our hospital.\\'\\n\\n\\'I liked it where I was.\\'\\n\\nMy mother\\'s mouth tightened.  \\'You should have behaved better, then.\\'\\n\\n\\'What?\\'\\n\\n\\'You shouldn\\'t have broken that mirror.  Then maybe they\\'d have let you\\nstay.\\'\\n\\nBut of course I knew the mirror had nothing to do with it.\\n\\n\\nI sat in bed with the covers up to my neck.\\n\\n\\'Why can\\'t I get up?  I\\'m not sick.\\'\\n\\n\\'Ward rounds,\\' the nurse said.  \\'You can get up after ward rounds.\\'\\nShe shoved the bed-curtains back and revealed a fat young Italian woman\\nin the next bed.\\n\\nThe Italian woman had a mass of tight black curls, starting at her\\nforehead, that rose in a mountainous pompadour and cascaded down her\\nback.  Whenever she moved, the huge arrangement of hair moved with her,\\nas if made of stiff black paper.\\n\\nThe woman looked at me and giggled.  \\'Why are you here?\\'  She didn\\'t\\nwait for an answer.  \\'I\\'m here on account of my French-Canadian\\nmother-in-law.\\'  She giggled again.  \\'My husband knows I can\\'t stand\\nher, and still he said she could come and visit us, and when she came,\\nmy tongue stuck out of my head, I couldn\\'t stop it.  They ran me into\\nEmergency and then they put me up here,\\' she lowered her voice, \\'along\\nwith the nuts.\\'  Then she said, \\'What\\'s the matter with you?\\'\\n\\nI turned her my full face, with the bulging purple and green eye.  \\'I\\ntried to kill myself.\\'\\n\\nThe woman stared at me.  Then, hastily, she snatched up a movie\\nmagazine from her bed-table and pretended to be reading.\\n\\nThe swinging door opposite my bed flew open, and a whole troop of young\\nboys and girls in white coats came in, with an older, grey-haired man.\\nThey were all smiling with bright, artificial smiles.  They grouped\\nthemselves at the foot of my bed.\\n\\n\\'And how are you feeling this morning, Miss Greenwood?\\'\\n\\nI tried to decide which one of them had spoken.  I hate saying anything\\nto a group of people.  When I talk to a group of people I always have\\nto single out one and talk to him, and all the while I am talking I\\nfeel the others are peering at me and taking unfair advantage.  I also\\nhate people to ask cheerfully how you are when they know you\\'re feeling\\nlike hell and expect you to say \\'Fine\\'.\\n\\n\\'I feel lousy.\\'\\n\\n\\'Lousy.  Hmm,\\' somebody said, and a boy ducked his head with a little\\nsmile.  Somebody else scribbled something on a clipboard.  Then\\nsomebody pulled a straight, solemn face and said, \\'And why do you feel\\nlousy?\\'\\n\\nI thought some of the boys and girls in that bright group might well be\\nfriends of Buddy Willard.  They would know I knew him, and they would\\nbe curious to see me, and afterwards they would gossip about me among\\nthemselves.  I wanted to be where nobody I knew could ever come.\\n\\n\\'I can\\'t sleep...\\'\\n\\nThey interrupted me.  \\'But the nurse says you slept last night.\\'  I\\nlooked round the crescent of fresh, strange faces.\\n\\n\\'I can\\'t read.\\'  I raised my voice.  \\'I can\\'t eat.\\'  It occurred to me\\nI\\'d been eating ravenously ever since I came to.\\n\\nThe people in the group had turned from me and were murmuring in low\\nvoices to each other.  Finally, the grey-haired man stepped out.\\n\\n\\'Thank you, Miss Greenwood.  You will be seen by one of the staff\\ndoctors presently.\\'\\n\\nThen the group moved on to the bed of the Italian woman.\\n\\n\\'And how are you feeling today, Mrs...\\' somebody said, and the name\\nsounded long and full of l\\'s, like Mrs Tomolillo.\\n\\nMrs Tomolillo giggled.  \\'Oh, I\\'m fine, doctor.  I\\'m just fine.\\'  Then\\nshe lowered her voice and whispered something I couldn\\'t hear.  One or\\ntwo people in the group glanced in my direction.  Then somebody said,\\n\\'All right, Mrs Tomolillo,\\' and somebody stepped out and pulled the\\nbed-curtain between us like a white wall.\\n\\n\\nI sat on one end of a wooden bench in the grassy square between the\\nfour brick walls of the hospital.  My mother, in her purple cartwheel\\ndress, sat at the other end.  She had her head propped in her hand,\\nindex finger on her cheek, and thumb under her chin.\\n\\nMrs Tomolillo was sitting with some dark-haired, laughing Italians on\\nthe next bench down.  Every time my mother moved, Mrs Tomolillo\\nimitated her.  Now Mrs Tomolillo was sitting with her index finger on\\nher cheek and her thumb under her chin, and her head tilted wistfully\\nto one side.\\n\\n\\'Don\\'t move,\\' I told my mother in a low voice.  \\'That woman\\'s imitating\\nyou.\\'\\n\\nMy mother turned to glance round, but quick as a wink, Mrs Tomolillo\\ndropped her fat white hands in her lap and started talking vigorously\\nto her friends.\\n\\n\\'Why no, she\\'s not,\\' my mother said.  \\'She\\'s not even paying any\\nattention to us.\\'\\n\\nBut the minute my mother turned round to me again, Mrs Tomolillo\\nmatched the tips of her fingers together the way my mother had just\\ndone and cast a black, mocking look at me.\\n\\nThe lawn was white with doctors.\\n\\nAll the time my mother and I had been sitting there, in the narrow cone\\nof sun that shone down between the tall brick walls, doctors had been\\ncoming up to me and introducing themselves.  \\'I\\'m Doctor Soandso, I\\'m\\nDoctor Soandso.\\'\\n\\nSome of them looked so young I knew they couldn\\'t be proper doctors,\\nand one of them had a queer name that sounded just like Doctor\\nSyphilis, so I began to look out for suspicious, fake names, and sure\\nenough, a dark-haired fellow who looked very like Doctor Gordon, except\\nthat he had black skin where Doctor Gordon\\'s skin was white, came up\\nand said, \\'I\\'m Doctor Pancreas,\\' and shook my hand.\\n\\nAfter introducing themselves, the doctors all stood within listening\\ndistance, only I couldn\\'t tell my mother that they were taking down\\nevery word we said without their hearing me, so I leaned over and\\nwhispered into her ear.\\n\\nMy mother drew back sharply.\\n\\n\\'Oh, Esther, I wish you would co-operate.  They say you don\\'t\\nco-operate.  They say you won\\'t talk to any of the doctors or make\\nanything in Occupational Therapy...\\'\\n\\n\\'I\\'ve got to get out of here,\\' I told her meaningly.  \\'Then I\\'d be all\\nright.  You got me in here,\\' I said.  \\'You get me out.\\'\\n\\nI thought if only I could persuade my mother to get me out of the\\nhospital I could work on her sympathies, like that boy with brain\\ndisease in the play, and convince her what was the best thing to do.\\n\\nTo my surprise, my mother said, \\'All right, I\\'ll try to get you\\nout--even if only to a better place.  If I try to get you out,\\' she\\nlaid a hand on my knee, \\'promise you\\'ll be good?\\'\\n\\nI spun round and glared straight at Doctor Syphilis, who stood at my\\nelbow taking notes on a tiny, almost invisible pad.  \\'I promise,\\' I\\nsaid in a loud, conspicuous voice.\\n\\n\\nThe negro wheeled the food cart into the patients\\' dining-room.  The\\nPsychiatric Ward at the hospital was very small--just two corridors in\\nan L-shape, lined with rooms, and an alcove of beds behind the OT shop,\\nwhere I was, and a little area with a table and a few seats by a window\\nin the corner of the L, which was our lounge and dining-room.\\n\\nUsually it was a shrunken old white man that brought our food, but\\ntoday it was a negro.  The negro was with a woman in blue stiletto\\nheels, and she was telling him what to do.  The negro kept grinning and\\nchuckling in a silly way.\\n\\nThen he carried a tray over to our table with three lidded tin tureens\\non it, and started banging the tureens down.  The woman left the room,\\nlocking the door behind her.  All the time the negro was banging down\\nthe tureens and then the dinted silver and the thick, white china\\nplates, he gawped at us with big, rolling eyes.\\n\\nI could tell we were his first crazy people.\\n\\nNobody at the table made a move to take the lids off the tin tureens,\\nand the nurse stood back to see if any of us would take the lids off\\nbefore she came to do it.  Usually Mrs Tomolillo had taken the lids off\\nand dished out everybody\\'s food like a little mother, but then they\\nsent her home, and nobody seemed to want to take her place.\\n\\nI was starving, so I lifted the lid off the first bowl.\\n\\n\\'That\\'s very nice of you, Esther,\\' the nurse said pleasantly.  \\'Would\\nyou like to take some beans and pass them round to the others?\\'\\n\\nI dished myself out a helping of green string beans and turned to pass\\nthe tureen to the enormous red-headed woman at my right.  This was the\\nfirst time the red-headed woman had been allowed up to the table.  I\\nhad seen her once, at the very end of the L-shaped corridor, standing\\nin front of an open door with bars on the square, inset window.\\n\\nShe had been yelling and laughing in a rude way and slapping her thighs\\nat the passing doctors, and the white-jacketed attendant who took care\\nof the people in that end of the ward was leaning against the hall\\nradiator, laughing himself sick.\\n\\nThe red-headed woman snatched the tureen from me and upended it on her\\nplate.  Beans mountained up in front of her and scattered over on to\\nher lap and on to the floor like stiff, green straws.\\n\\n\\'Oh, Mrs Mole!\\' the nurse said in a sad voice.  \\'I think you better eat\\nin your room today.\\'\\n\\nAnd she returned most of the beans to the tureen and gave it to the\\nperson next to Mrs Mole and led Mrs Mole off.  All the way down the\\nhall to her room, Mrs Mole kept turning round and making leering faces\\nat us, and ugly, oinking noises.\\n\\nThe negro had come back and was starting to collect the empty plates of\\npeople who hadn\\'t dished out any beans yet.\\n\\n\\'We\\'re not done,\\' I told him.  \\'You can just wait.\\'\\n\\n\\'Mah, mah!\\'  The negro widened his eyes in mock wonder.  He glanced\\nround.  The nurse had not yet returned from locking up Mrs Mole.  The\\nnegro made me an insolent bow.  \\'Miss Mucky-Muck,\\' he said under his\\nbreath.\\n\\nI lifted the lid off the second tureen and uncovered a wodge of\\nmacaroni, stone-cold and stuck together in a gluey paste.  The third\\nand last tureen was chock-full of baked beans.\\n\\nNow I knew perfectly well you didn\\'t serve two kinds of beans together\\nat a meal.  Beans and carrots, or beans and peas, maybe, but never\\nbeans and beans.  The negro was just trying to see how much we would\\ntake.\\n\\nThe nurse came back, and the negro edged off at a distance.  I ate as\\nmuch as I could of the baked beans.  Then I rose from the table,\\npassing round to the side where the nurse couldn\\'t see me below the\\nwaist, and behind the negro, who was clearing the dirty plates.  I drew\\nmy foot back and gave him a sharp, hard kick on the calf of the leg.\\n\\nThe negro leapt away with a yelp and rolled his eyes at me.  \\'Oh Miz,\\noh Miz,\\' he moaned, rubbing his leg.  \\'You shouldn\\'t of done that, you\\nshouldn\\'t, you reely shouldn\\'t.\\'\\n\\n\\'That\\'s what _you_ get,\\' I said, and stared him in the eye.\\n\\n\\n\\'Don\\'t you want to get up today?\\'\\n\\n\\'No.\\'  I huddled down more deeply in the bed and pulled the sheet up\\nover my head.  Then I lifted a corner of the sheet and peered out.  The\\nnurse was shaking down the thermometer she had just removed from my\\nmouth.\\n\\n\\'You see, it\\'s normal.\\'  I had looked at the thermometer before she\\ncame to collect it, the way I always did.  \\'You see, it\\'s normal, what\\ndo you keep taking it for?\\'\\n\\nI wanted to tell her that if only something were wrong with my body it\\nwould be fine, I would rather have anything wrong with my body than\\nsomething wrong with my head, but the idea seemed so involved and\\nwearisome that I didn\\'t say anything.  I only burrowed down further in\\nthe bed.\\n\\nThen, through the sheet, I felt a slight, annoying pressure on my leg.\\nI peeped out.  The nurse had set her tray of thermometers on my bed\\nwhile she turned her back and took the pulse of the person who lay next\\nto me, in Mrs Tomolillo\\'s place.\\n\\nA heavy naughtiness pricked through my veins, irritating and attractive\\nas the hurt of a loose tooth.  I yawned and stirred, as if about to\\nturn over, and edged my foot under the box.\\n\\n\\'Oh!\\'  The nurse\\'s cry sounded like a cry for help, and another nurse\\ncame running.  \\'Look what you\\'ve done!\\'\\n\\nI poked my head out of the covers and stared over the edge of the bed.\\nAround the overturned enamel tray, a star of thermometer shards\\nglittered, and balls of mercury trembled like celestial dew.\\n\\n\\'I\\'m sorry,\\' I said.  \\'It was an accident.\\'\\n\\nThe second nurse fixed me with a baleful eye.  \\'You did it on purpose.\\nI _saw_ you.\\'\\n\\nThen she hurried off, and almost immediately two attendants came and\\nwheeled me, bed and all, down to Mrs Mole\\'s old room, but not before I\\nhad scooped up a ball of mercury.  Soon after they had locked the door,\\nI could see the negro\\'s face, a molasses-coloured moon, risen at the\\nwindow grating, but I pretended not to notice.\\n\\nI opened my fingers a crack, like a child with a secret, and smiled at\\nthe silver globe cupped in my palm.  If I dropped it, it would break\\ninto a million little replicas of itself, and if I pushed them near\\neach other, they would fuse, without a crack, into one whole again.\\n\\nI smiled and smiled at the small silver ball.\\n\\nI couldn\\'t imagine what they had done with Mrs Mole.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter Fifteen\\n\\nPhilomena Guinea\\'s black Cadillac eased through the tight, five o\\'clock\\ntraffic like a ceremonial car.  Soon it would cross one of the brief\\nbridges that arched the Charles, and I would, without thinking, open\\nthe door and plunge out through the stream of traffic to the rail of\\nthe bridge.  One jump, and the water would be over my head.\\n\\nIdly I twisted a kleenex to small, pill-sized pellets between my\\nfingers and watched my chance.  I sat in the middle of the back seat of\\nthe Cadillac, my mother on one side of me, and my brother on the other,\\nboth leaning slightly forward, like diagonal bars, one across each car\\ndoor.\\n\\nIn front of me I could see the spam-coloured expanse of the chauffeur\\'s\\nneck, sandwiched between a blue cap and the shoulders of a bluejacket\\nand, next to him, like a frail, exotic bird, the silver hair and\\nemerald-feathered hat of Philomena Guinea, the famous novelist.\\n\\nI wasn\\'t quite sure why Mrs Guinea had turned up.  All I knew was that\\nshe had interested herself in my case and that at one time, at the peak\\nof her career, she had been in an asylum as well.\\n\\nMy mother said that Mrs Guinea had sent her a telegram from the\\nBahamas, where she read about me in a Boston paper.  Mrs Guinea had\\ntelegrammed, \\'Is there a boy in the case?\\'\\n\\nIf there was a boy in the case, Mrs Guinea couldn\\'t, of course, have\\nanything to do with it.\\n\\nBut my mother had telegrammed back, \\'No, it is Esther\\'s writing.  She\\nthinks she will never write again.\\'\\n\\nSo Mrs Guinea had flown back to Boston and taken me out of the cramped\\ncity hospital ward, and now she was driving me to a private hospital\\nthat had grounds and golf courses and gardens, like a country club,\\nwhere she would pay for me, as if I had a scholarship, until the\\ndoctors she knew of there had made me well.\\n\\nMy mother told me I should be grateful.  She said I had used up almost\\nall her money, and if it weren\\'t for Mrs Guinea she didn\\'t know where\\nI\\'d be.  I knew where I\\'d be, though.  I\\'d be in the big state hospital\\nin the country, cheek by jowl to this private place.\\n\\nI knew I should be grateful to Mrs Guinea, only I couldn\\'t feel a\\nthing.  If Mrs Guinea had given me a ticket to Europe, or a\\nround-the-world cruise, it wouldn\\'t have made one scrap of difference\\nto me, because wherever I sat--on the deck of a ship or at a street\\ncafe in Paris or Bangkok--I would be sitting under the same glass bell\\njar, stewing in my own sour air.\\n\\nBlue sky opened its dome above the river, and the river was dotted with\\nsails.  I readied myself, but immediately my mother and my brother each\\nlaid one hand on a door handle.  The tyres hummed briefly over the\\ngrill of the bridge.  Water, sails, blue sky and suspended gulls\\nflashed by like an improbable postcard, and we were across.\\n\\nI sank back in the grey, plush seat and closed my eyes.  The air of the\\nbell jar wadded round me and I couldn\\'t stir.\\n\\n\\nI had my own room again.\\n\\nIt reminded me of the room in Doctor Gordon\\'s hospital--a bed, a\\nbureau, a closet, a table and chair.  A window with a screen, but no\\nbars.  My room was on the first floor, and the window, a short distance\\nabove the pine-needle-padded ground, overlooked a wooded yard ringed by\\na red brick wall.  If I jumped I wouldn\\'t even bruise my knees.  The\\ninner surface of the tall wall seemed smooth as glass.\\n\\nThe journey over the bridge had unnerved me.\\n\\nI had missed a perfectly good chance.  The river water passed me by\\nlike an untouched drink.  I suspected that even if my mother and\\nbrother had not been there I would have made no move to jump.\\n\\nWhen I enrolled in the main building of the hospital, a slim young\\nwoman had come up and introduced herself.  \\'My name is Doctor Nolan.  I\\nam to be Esther\\'s doctor.\\'\\n\\nI was surprised to have a woman.  I didn\\'t think they had woman\\npsychiatrists.  This woman was a cross between Myrna Loy and my mother.\\nShe wore a white blouse and a full skirt gathered at the waist by a\\nwide leather belt, and stylish, crescent-shaped spectacles.\\n\\nBut after a nurse had led me across the lawn to the gloomy brick\\nbuilding called Caplan, where I would live, Doctor Nolan didn\\'t come to\\nsee me, a whole lot of strange men came instead.\\n\\nI lay on my bed under the thick white blanket, and they entered my\\nroom, one by one, and introduced themselves.  I couldn\\'t understand why\\nthere should be so many of them, or why they would want to introduce\\nthemselves, and I began to think they were testing me, to see if I\\nnoticed there were too many of them, and I grew wary.\\n\\nFinally, a handsome, white-haired doctor came in and said he was the\\ndirector of the hospital.  Then he started talking about the Pilgrims\\nand Indians and who had the land after them, and what rivers ran\\nnearby, and who had built the first hospital, and how it had burned\\ndown, and who had built the next hospital, until I thought he must be\\nwaiting to see when I would interrupt him and tell him I knew all that\\nabout rivers and Pilgrims was a lot of nonsense.\\n\\nBut then I thought some of it might be true, so I tried to sort out\\nwhat was likely to be true and what wasn\\'t, only before I could do\\nthat, he had said good-bye.\\n\\nI waited till I heard the voices of all the doctors die away.  Then I\\nthrew back the white blanket and put on my shoes and walked out into\\nthe hall.  Nobody stopped me, so I walked round the corner of my wing\\nof the hall and down another, longer hall, past an open dining room.\\n\\nA maid in a green uniform was setting the tables for supper.  There\\nwere white linen table-cloths and glasses and paper napkins.  I stored\\nthe fact that there were real glasses in the corner of my mind the way\\na squirrel stores a nut.  At the city hospital we had drunk out of\\npaper cups and had no knives to cut our meat.  The meat had always been\\nso overcooked we could cut it with a fork.\\n\\nFinally I arrived at a big lounge with shabby furniture and a\\nthreadbare rug.  A girl with a round pasty face and short black hair\\nwas sitting in an armchair, reading a magazine.  She reminded me of a\\nGirl Scout leader I\\'d had once.  I glanced at her feet, and sure\\nenough, she wore those flat brown leather shoes with fringed tongues\\nlapping down over the front that are supposed to be so sporty, and the\\nends of the laces were knobbed with little imitation acorns.\\n\\nThe girl raised her eyes and smiled.  \\'I\\'m Valerie.  Who are you?\\'\\n\\nI pretended I hadn\\'t heard and walked out of the lounge to the end of\\nthe next wing.  On the way, I passed a waist-high door behind which I\\nsaw some nurses.\\n\\n\\'Where is everybody?\\'\\n\\n\\'Out.\\'  The nurse was writing something over and over on little pieces\\nof adhesive tape.  I leaned across the gate of the door to see what she\\nwas writing, and it was E. Greenwood, E. Greenwood, E. Greenwood, E.\\nGreenwood.\\n\\n\\'Out where?\\'\\n\\n\\'Oh, OT, the golf course, playing badminton.\\'\\n\\nI noticed a pile of clothes on a chair beside the nurse.  They were the\\nsame clothes the nurse in the first hospital had been packing into the\\npatent leather case when I broke the mirror.  The nurse began sticking\\nthe labels on to the clothes.\\n\\nI walked back to the lounge.  I couldn\\'t understand what these people\\nwere doing, playing badminton and golf.  They mustn\\'t be really sick at\\nall, to do that.\\n\\nI sat down near Valerie and observed her carefully.  Yes, I thought,\\nshe might just as well be in a Girl Scout camp.  She was reading her\\ntatty copy of _Vogue_ with intense interest.\\n\\n\\'What the hell is she doing here,\\' I wondered.  \\'There\\'s nothing the\\nmatter with her.\\'\\n\\n\\n\\'Do you mind if I smoke?\\'  Doctor Nolan leaned back in the armchair\\nnext to my bed.\\n\\nI said no, I liked the smell of smoke.  I thought if Doctor Nolan\\nsmoked, she might stay longer.  This was the first time she had come to\\ntalk with me.  When she left I would simply lapse into the old\\nblankness.\\n\\n\\'Tell me about Doctor Gordon,\\' Doctor Nolan said suddenly.  \\'Did you\\nlike him?\\'\\n\\nI gave Doctor Nolan a wary look.  I thought the doctors must all be in\\nit together, and that somewhere in this hospital, in a hidden corner,\\nthere reposed a machine exactly like Doctor Gordon\\'s, ready to jolt me\\nout of my skin.\\n\\n\\'No,\\' I said.  \\'I didn\\'t like him at all.\\'\\n\\n\\'That\\'s interesting.  Why?\\'\\n\\n\\'I didn\\'t like what he did to me,\\'\\n\\n\\'Did to you?\\'\\n\\nI told Doctor Nolan about the machine, and the blue flashes, and the\\njolting and the noise.  While I was telling her she went very still.\\n\\n\\'That was a mistake,\\' she said then.  \\'It\\'s not supposed to be like\\nthat.\\'\\n\\nI stared at her.\\n\\n\\'If it\\'s done properly,\\' Doctor Nolan said, \\'it\\'s like going to sleep.\\'\\n\\n\\'If anyone does that to me again I\\'ll kill myself.\\'\\n\\nDoctor Nolan said firmly, \\'You won\\'t have any shock treatments here.\\nOr if you do,\\' she amended, \\'I\\'ll tell you about it beforehand, and I\\npromise you it won\\'t be anything like what you had before.  Why,\\' she\\nfinished, \\'some people even like them.\\'\\n\\nAfter Doctor Nolan had gone I found a box of matches on the\\nwindow-sill.  It wasn\\'t an ordinary-size box, but an extremely tiny\\nbox.  I opened it and exposed a row of little white sticks with pinks\\ntips.  I tried to light one, and it crumpled in my hand.\\n\\nI couldn\\'t think why Doctor Nolan would have left me such a stupid\\nthing.  Perhaps she wanted to see if I would give it back.  Carefully I\\nstored the toy matches in the hem of my new wool bathrobe.  If Doctor\\nNolan asked me for the matches, I would say I\\'d thought they were made\\nof candy and had eaten them.\\n\\n\\nA new woman had moved into the room next to mine.\\n\\nI thought she must be the only person in the building who was newer\\nthan I was, so she wouldn\\'t know how really bad I was, the way the rest\\ndid.  I thought I might go in and make friends.\\n\\nThe woman was lying on her bed in a purple dress that fastened at the\\nneck with a cameo brooch and reached midway between her knees and her\\nshoes.  She had rusty hair knotted in a schoolmarmish bun, and thin,\\nsilver-rimmed spectacles attached to her breast pocket with a black\\nelastic.\\n\\n\\'Hello,\\' I said conversationally, sitting down on the edge of the bed.\\n\\'My name\\'s Esther, what\\'s your name?\\'\\n\\nThe woman didn\\'t stir, she just stared up at the ceiling.  I felt hurt.\\nI thought maybe Valerie or somebody had told her when she first came in\\nhow stupid I was.\\n\\nA nurse popped her head in at the door.\\n\\n\\'Oh, there you are,\\' she said to me.  \\'Visiting Miss Norris.  How\\nnice!\\'  And she disappeared again.\\n\\nI don\\'t know how long I sat there, watching the woman in purple and\\nwondering if her pursed, pink lips would open, and if they did open,\\nwhat they would say.\\n\\nFinally, without speaking or looking at me, Miss Norris swung her feet\\nin their high, black, buttoned boots over the other side of the bed and\\nwalked out of the room.  I thought she might be trying to get rid of me\\nin a subtle way.  Quietly, at a little distance, I followed her down\\nthe hall.\\n\\nMiss Norris reached the door of the dining-room and paused.  All the\\nway to the dining-room she had walked precisely, placing her feet in\\nthe very centre of the cabbage roses that twined through the pattern of\\nthe carpet.  She waited a moment and then, one by one, lifted her feet\\nover the door-sill and into the dining-room as though stepping over an\\ninvisible shin-high stile.\\n\\nShe sat down at one of the round, linen-covered tables and unfolded a\\nnapkin in her lap.\\n\\n\\'It\\'s not supper for an hour yet,\\' the cook called out of the kitchen.\\n\\nBut Miss Norris didn\\'t answer.  She just stared straight ahead of her\\nin a polite way.\\n\\nI pulled up a chair opposite her at the table and unfolded a napkin.\\nWe didn\\'t speak, but sat there, in a close, sisterly silence, until the\\ngong for supper sounded down the hall.\\n\\n\\n\\'Lie down,\\' the nurse said.  \\'I\\'m going to give you another injection.\\'\\n\\nI rolled over on my stomach on the bed and hitched up my skirt.  Then I\\npulled down the trousers of my silk pyjamas.\\n\\n\\'My word, what all have you got under there?\\'\\n\\n\\'Pyjamas.  So I won\\'t have to bother getting in and out of them all the\\ntime.\\'\\n\\nThe nurse made a little clucking noise.  Then she said, \\'Which side?\\'\\nIt was an old joke.\\n\\nI raised my head and glanced back at my bare buttocks.  They were\\nbruised purple and green and blue from past injections.  The left side\\nlooked darker than the right.\\n\\n\\'The right.\\'\\n\\n\\'You name it.\\'  The nurse jabbed the needle in, and I winced, savouring\\nthe tiny hurt.  Three times each day the nurses injected me, and about\\nan hour after each injection they gave me a cup of sugary fruit juice\\nand stood by, watching me drink it.\\n\\n\\'Lucky you,\\' Valerie said.  \\'You\\'re on insulin.\\'\\n\\n\\'Nothing happens.\\'\\n\\n\\'Oh, it will.  I\\'ve had it.  Tell me when you get a reaction.\\'\\n\\nBut I never seemed to get any reaction.  I just grew fatter and fatter.\\nAlready I filled the new, too-big clothes my mother had bought, and\\nwhen I peered down at my plump stomach and my broad hips I thought it\\nwas a good thing Mrs Guinea hadn\\'t seen me like this, because I looked\\njust as if I were going to have a baby.\\n\\n\\n\\'Have you seen my scars?\\'\\n\\nValerie pushed aside her black bang and indicated two pale marks, one\\non either side of her forehead, as if at some time she had started to\\nsprout horns, but cut them off.\\n\\nWe were walking, just the two of us, with the Sports Therapist in the\\nasylum gardens.  Nowadays I was let out on walk privileges more and\\nmore often.  They never let Miss Norris out at all.\\n\\nValerie said Miss Norris shouldn\\'t be in Caplan, but in a building for\\nworse people called Wymark.\\n\\n\\'Do you know what these scars are?\\' Valerie persisted.\\n\\n\\'No.  What are they?\\'\\n\\n\\'I\\'ve had a lobotomy.\\'\\n\\nI looked at Valerie in awe, appreciating for the first time her\\nperpetual marble calm.  \\'How do you feel?\\'\\n\\n\\'Fine.  I\\'m not angry any more.  Before, I was always angry.  I was in\\nWymark, before, and now I\\'m in Caplan.  I can go to town, now, or\\nshopping or to a movie, along with a nurse.\\'\\n\\n\\'What will you do when you get out?\\'\\n\\n\\'Oh, I\\'m not leaving,\\' Valerie laughed.  \\'I like it here.\\'\\n\\n\\n\\'Moving day!\\'\\n\\n\\'Why should I be moving?\\'\\n\\nThe nurse went on blithely opening and shutting my drawers, emptying\\nthe closet and folding my belongings into the black overnight case.\\n\\nI thought they must at last be moving me to Wymark.\\n\\n\\'Oh, you\\'re only moving to the front of the house,\\' the nurse said\\ncheerfully.  \\'You\\'ll like it.  There\\'s lots more sun.\\'\\n\\nWhen we came out into the hall, I saw that Miss Norris was moving too.\\nA nurse, young and cheerful as my own, stood in the doorway of Miss\\nNorris\\'s room, helping Miss Norris into a purple coat with a scrawny\\nsquirrel-fur collar.\\n\\nHour after hour I had been keeping watch by Miss Norris\\'s bedside,\\nrefusing the diversion of OT and walks and badminton matches and even\\nthe weekly movies, which I enjoyed, and which Miss Norris never went\\nto, simply to brood over the pale, speechless circlet of her lips.\\n\\nI thought how exciting it would be if she opened her mouth and spoke,\\nand I rushed out into the hall and announced this to the nurses.  They\\nwould praise me for encouraging Miss Norris, and I would probably be\\nallowed shopping privileges and movie privileges downtown, and my\\nescape would be assured.\\n\\nBut in all my hours of vigil Miss Norris hadn\\'t said a word.\\n\\n\\'Where are you moving to?\\' I asked her now.\\n\\nThe nurse touched Miss Norris\\'s elbow, and Miss Norris jerked into\\nmotion like a doll on wheels.\\n\\n\\'She\\'s going to Wymark,\\' my nurse told me in a low voice.  \\'I\\'m afraid\\nMiss Norris isn\\'t moving up like you.\\'\\n\\nI watched Miss Norris lift one foot, and then the other, over the\\ninvisible stile that barred the front doorsill.\\n\\n\\'I\\'ve a surprise for you,\\' the nurse said as she installed me in a\\nsunny room in the front wing overlooking the green golf links.\\n\\'Somebody you know\\'s just come today.\\'\\n\\n\\'Somebody I know?\\'\\n\\nThe nurse laughed.  \\'Don\\'t look at me like that.  It\\'s not a\\npoliceman.\\'  Then, as I didn\\'t say anything, she added, \\'She says she\\'s\\nan old friend of yours.  She lives next door.  Why don\\'t you pay her a\\nvisit?\\'\\n\\nI thought the nurse must be joking, and that if I knocked on the door\\nnext to mine I would hear no answer, but go in and find Miss Norris,\\nbuttoned into her purple, squirrel-collared coat and lying on the bed,\\nher mouth blooming out of the quiet vase of her body like the bud of a\\nrose.\\n\\nStill, I went out and knocked on the neighbouring door.\\n\\n\\'Come in!\\' called a gay voice.\\n\\nI opened the door a crack and peered into the room.  The big, horsey\\ngirl in jodhpurs sitting by the window glanced up with a broad smile.\\n\\n\\'Esther!\\'  She sounded out of breath, as if she had been running a\\nlong, long distance and only just come to a halt.  \\'How nice to see\\nyou.  They told me you were here.\\'\\n\\n\\'Joan?\\' I said tentatively, then \\'Joan!\\' in confusion and disbelief.\\n\\nJoan beamed, revealing her large, gleaming, unmistakable teeth.\\n\\n\\'It\\'s really me.  I thought you\\'d be surprised.\\'\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter Sixteen\\n\\nJoan\\'s room, with its closet and bureau and table and chair and white\\nblanket with the big blue C on it, was a mirror image of my own.  It\\noccurred to me that Joan, hearing where I was, had engaged a room at\\nthe asylum on pretence, simply as a joke.  That would explain why she\\nhad told the nurse I was her friend.  I had never known Joan, except at\\na cool distance.\\n\\n\\'How did you get here?\\'  I curled up on Joan\\'s bed.\\n\\n\\'I read about you,\\' Joan said.\\n\\n\\'What?\\'\\n\\n\\'I read about you, and I ran away.\\'\\n\\n\\'How do you mean?\\' I said evenly.\\n\\n\\'Well,\\' Joan leaned back in the chintz-flowered asylum armchair, \\'I had\\na summer job working for the chapter head of some fraternity, like the\\nMasons, you know, but not the Masons, and I felt terrible.  I had these\\nbunions, I could hardly walk--in the last days I had to wear rubber\\nboots to work, instead of shoes, and you can imagine what _that_ did to\\nmy morale...\\'\\n\\nI thought either Joan must be crazy--wearing rubber boots to work, or\\nshe must be trying to see how crazy I was--believing all that.\\nBesides, only old people ever got bunions.  I decided to pretend I\\nthought she was crazy, and that I was only humouring her along.\\n\\n\\'I always feel lousy without shoes,\\' I said with an ambiguous smile.\\n\\'Did your feet hurt much?\\'\\n\\n\\'Terribly.  And my boss--he\\'d just separated from his wife, he couldn\\'t\\ncome right out and get a divorce, because that wouldn\\'t go with this\\nfraternal order--my boss kept buzzing me in every other minute, and\\neach time I moved, my feet hurt like the devil, but the second I\\'d sit\\ndown at my desk again, buzz went the buzzer, and he\\'d have something\\nelse he wanted to get off his chest...\\'\\n\\n\\'Why didn\\'t you quit?\\'\\n\\n\\'Oh, I did quit, more or less.  I stayed off work on sick leave.  I\\ndidn\\'t go out.  I didn\\'t see anyone.  I stowed the telephone in a\\ndrawer and never answered it...\\n\\n\\'Then my doctor sent me to a psychiatrist at this big hospital.  I had\\nan appointment for twelve o\\'clock, and I was in an awful state.\\nFinally, at half past twelve, the receptionist came out and told me the\\ndoctor had gone to lunch.  She asked me if I wanted to wait, and I said\\nyes.\\'\\n\\n\\'Did he come back?\\'   The story sounded rather involved for Joan to\\nhave made up out of whole cloth, but I led her on, to see what would\\ncome of it.\\n\\n\\'Oh yes.  I was going to kill myself, mind you.  I said \"If this doctor\\ndoesn\\'t do the trick, that\\'s the end.\"  Well, the receptionist led me\\ndown a long hall, and just as we got to the door she turned to me and\\nsaid, \"You won\\'t mind if there are a few students with the doctor, will\\nyou?\"  What could I say?  \"Oh no,\" I said.  I walked in and found nine\\npairs of eyes fixed on me.  Nine!  Eighteen separate eyes.\\n\\n\\'Now, if that receptionist had told me there were going to be nine\\npeople in that room, I\\'d have walked out on the spot.  But there I was,\\nand it was too late to do a thing about it.  Well, on this particular\\nday I happened to be wearing a fur coat...\\'\\n\\n\\'In August?\\n\\n\\'Oh, it was one of those cold, wet days, and I thought, my first\\npsychiatrist--you know.  Anyway, this psychiatrist kept eyeing that fur\\ncoat the whole time I talked to him, and I could just see what he\\nthought of my asking to pay the student\\'s cut-rate instead of the full\\nfee.  I could see the dollar signs in his eyes.  Well, I told him I\\ndon\\'t know whatall--about the bunions and the telephone in the drawer\\nand how I wanted to kill myself, and then he asked me to wait outside\\nwhile he discussed my case with the others, and when he called me back\\nin, you know what he said?\\'\\n\\n\\'What?\\'\\n\\n\\'He folded his hands together and looked at me and said, \"Miss Gilling,\\nwe have decided that you would benefit by group therapy.\"\\'\\n\\n\\'_Group_ therapy?\\'  I thought I must sound phoney as an echo chamber,\\nbut Joan didn\\'t pay any notice.\\n\\n\\'That\\'s what he said.  Can you imagine me wanting to kill myself, and\\ncoming round to chat about it with a whole pack of strangers, and most\\nof them no better than myself...\\'\\n\\n\\'That\\'s crazy.\\'  I was growing involved in spite of myself.  \\'That\\'s\\nnot even _hu_man.\\'\\n\\n\\'That\\'s just what I said.  I went straight home and wrote that doctor a\\nletter.  I wrote him one beautiful letter about how a man like that had\\nno business setting himself up to help sick people...\\'\\n\\n\\'Did you get any answer?\\'\\n\\n\\'I don\\'t know.  That was the day I read about you.\\'\\n\\n\\'How do you mean?\\'\\n\\n\\'Oh,\\' Joan said, \\'about how the police thought you were dead and all.\\nI\\'ve got a pile of clippings somewhere.\\'  She heaved herself up, and I\\nhad a strong horsey whiff that made my nostrils prickle.  Joan had been\\na champion horse-jumper at the annual college gymkhana, and I wondered\\nif she had been sleeping in a stable.\\n\\nJoan rummaged in her open suitcase and came up with a fistful of\\nclippings.\\n\\n\\'Here, have a look.\\'\\n\\nThe first clipping showed a big, blown-up picture of a girl with\\nblack-shadowed eyes and black lips spread in a grin.  I couldn\\'t\\nimagine where such a tarty picture had been taken until I noticed the\\nBloomingdale ear-rings and the Bloomingdale necklace glinting out of it\\nwith bright, white highlights, like imitation stars.\\n\\nSCHOLARSHIP GIRL MISSING.  MOTHER WORRIED.  The article under the\\npicture told how this girl had disappeared from her home on August\\n17th, wearing a green skirt and a white blouse, and had left a note\\nsaying she was taking a long walk.  _When Miss Greenwood had not\\nreturned by midnight_, it said, _her mother called the town police_.\\n\\nThe next clipping showed a picture of my mother and brother and me\\ngrouped together in our backyard and smiling.  I couldn\\'t think who had\\ntaken that picture either, until I saw I was wearing dungarees and\\nwhite sneakers and remembered that was what I wore in my\\nspinach-picking summer, and how Dodo Conway had dropped by and taken\\nsome family snaps of the three of us one hot afternoon.  _Mrs Greenwood\\nasked that this picture be printed in hopes that it will encourage her\\ndaughter to return home_.\\n\\n\\nSLEEPING PILLS FEARED MISSING WITH GIRL.\\n\\n\\nA dark, midnight picture of about a dozen moon-faced people in a wood.\\nI thought the people at the end of the row looked queer and unusually\\nshort until I realized they were not people, but dogs.  _Bloodhounds\\nused in search for missing girl.  Police Sgt Bill Hindly says: It\\ndoesn\\'t look good_.\\n\\n\\nGIRL FOUND ALIVE!\\n\\n\\nThe last picture showed policemen lifting a long, limp blanket roll\\nwith a featureless cabbage head into the back of an ambulance.  Then it\\ntold how my mother had been down in the cellar, doing the week\\'s\\nlaundry, when she heard faint groans coming from a disused hole...\\n\\nI laid the clippings on the white spread of the bed.\\n\\n\\'You keep them,\\' Joan said.  \\'You ought to stick them in a scrapbook.\\'\\n\\nI folded the clippings and slipped them in my pocket.\\n\\n\\'I read about you,\\' Joan went on.  \\'Not how they found you, but\\neverything up to that, and I put all my money together and took the\\nfirst plane to New York.\\'\\n\\n\\'Why New York?\\'\\n\\n\\'Oh, I thought it would be easier to kill myself in New York.\\'\\n\\n\\'What did you do?\\'\\n\\nJoan grinned sheepishly and stretched out her hands, palm up.  Like a\\nminiature mountain range, large, reddish weals upheaved across the\\nwhite flesh of her wrists.\\n\\n\\'How did you do that?\\'  For the first time it occurred to me Joan and I\\nmight have something in common.\\n\\n\\'I shoved my fists through my room-mate\\'s window.\\'\\n\\n\\'What room-mate?\\'\\n\\n\\'My old college room-mate.  She was working in New York, and I couldn\\'t\\nthink of anyplace else to stay, and besides, I\\'d hardly any money left,\\nso I went to stay with her.  My parents found me there--she\\'d written\\nthem I was acting funny--and my father flew straight down and brought\\nme back.\\'\\n\\n\\'But you\\'re all right now.\\' I made it a statement.\\n\\nJoan considered me with her bright, pebble-grey eyes.  \\'I guess so,\\'\\nshe said.  \\'Aren\\'t you?\\'\\n\\n\\nI had fallen asleep after the evening meal.\\n\\nI was awakened by a loud voice.  _Mrs Bannister, Mrs Bannister, Mrs\\nBannister, Mrs Bannister_.  As I pulled out of sleep, I found I was\\nbeating on the bedpost with my hands and calling.  The sharp, wry\\nfigure of Mrs Bannister, the night nurse, scurried into view.\\n\\n\\'Here, we don\\'t want you to break this.\\'\\n\\nShe unfastened the band of my watch.\\n\\n\\'What\\'s the matter?  What happened?\\'\\n\\nMrs Bannister\\'s face twisted into a quick smile.  \\'You\\'ve had a\\nreaction.\\'\\n\\n\\'A reaction?\\'\\n\\n\\'Yes, how do you feel?\\'\\n\\n\\'Funny.  Sort of light and airy.\\'\\n\\nMrs Bannister helped me sit up.\\n\\n\\'You\\'ll be better now.  You\\'ll be better in no time.  Would you like\\nsome hot milk?\\'\\n\\n\\'Yes.\\'\\n\\nAnd when Mrs Bannister held the cup to my lips, I fanned the hot milk\\nout on my tongue as it went down, tasting it luxuriously, the way a\\nbaby tastes its mother.\\n\\n\\n\\'Mrs Bannister tells me you had a reaction.\\'  Doctor Nolan seated\\nherself in the armchair by the window and took out a tiny box of\\nmatches.  The box looked exactly like the one I had hidden in the hem\\nof my bathrobe, and for a moment I wondered if a nurse had discovered\\nit there and given it back to Doctor Nolan on the quiet.\\n\\nDoctor Nolan scraped a match on the side of the box.  A hot yellow\\nflame jumped into life, and I watched her suck it up into the cigarette.\\n\\n\\'Mrs B. says you felt better.\\'\\n\\n\\'I did for a while.  Now I\\'m the same again.\\'\\n\\n\\'I\\'ve news for you.\\'\\n\\nI waited.  Every day now, for I didn\\'t know how many days, I had spent\\nthe mornings and afternoons and evenings wrapped up in my white blanket\\non the deck chair in the alcove, pretending to read.  I had a dim\\nnotion that Doctor Nolan was allowing me a certain number of days and\\nthen she would say just what Doctor Gordon had said: \\'I\\'m sorry, you\\ndon\\'t seem to have improved, I think you\\'d better have some shock\\ntreatments...\\'\\n\\n\\'Well, don\\'t you want to hear what it is?\\'\\n\\n\\'What?\\' I said dully, and braced myself.\\n\\n\\'You\\'re not to have any more visitors for a while.\\'\\n\\nI stared at Doctor Nolan in surprise.  \\'Why that\\'s wonderful.\\'\\n\\n\\'I thought you\\'d be pleased.\\'  She smiled.\\n\\nThen I looked, and Doctor Nolan looked, at the waste-basket beside my\\nbureau.  Out of the waste-basket poked the blood-red buds of a dozen\\nlong-stemmed roses.\\n\\nThat afternoon my mother had come to visit me.\\n\\nMy mother was only one in a long stream of visitors--my former\\nemployer, the lady Christian Scientist, who walked on the lawn with me\\nand talked about the mist going up from the earth in the Bible, and the\\nmist being error, and my whole trouble being that I believed in the\\nmist, and the minute I stopped believing in it, it would disappear and\\nI would see I had always been well, and the English teacher I had in\\nhigh school who came and tried to teach me how to play Scrabble,\\nbecause he thought it might revive my old interest in words, and\\nPhilomena Guinea herself, who wasn\\'t at all satisfied with what the\\ndoctors were doing and kept telling them so.\\n\\nI hated these visits.\\n\\nI would be sitting in my alcove or in my room, and a smiling nurse\\nwould pop in and announce one or another of the visitors.  Once they\\'d\\neven brought the minister of the Unitarian church, whom I\\'d never\\nreally liked at all.  He was terribly nervous the whole time, and I\\ncould tell he thought I was crazy as a loon, because I told him I\\nbelieved in hell, and that certain people, like me, had to live in hell\\nbefore they died, to make up for missing out on it after death, since\\nthey didn\\'t believe in life after death, and what each person believed\\nhappened to him when he died.\\n\\nI hated these visits, because I kept feeling the visitors measuring my\\nfat and stringy hair against what I had been and what they wanted me to\\nbe, and I knew they went away utterly confounded.\\n\\nI thought if they left me alone I might have some peace.\\n\\nMy mother was the worst.  She never scolded me, but kept begging me,\\nwith a sorrowful face, to tell her what she had done wrong.  She said\\nshe was sure the doctors thought she had done something wrong because\\nthey asked her a lot of questions about my toilet training, and I had\\nbeen perfectly trained at a very early age and given her no trouble\\nwhatsoever.\\n\\nThat afternoon my mother had brought me the roses.\\n\\n\\'Save them for my funeral,\\' I\\'d said.\\n\\nMy mother\\'s face puckered, and she looked ready to cry.\\n\\n\\'But Esther, don\\'t you remember what day it is today?\\'\\n\\n\\'No.\\'\\n\\nI thought it might be Saint Valentine\\'s day.\\n\\n\\'It\\'s your _birth_day.\\'\\n\\nAnd that was when I had dumped the roses in the wastebasket.\\n\\n\\'That was a silly thing for her to do,\\' I said to Doctor Nolan.\\n\\nDoctor Nolan nodded.  She seemed to know what I meant.\\n\\n\\'I hate her,\\' I said, and waited for the blow to fall.\\n\\nBut Doctor Nolan only smiled at me as if something had pleased her\\nvery, very much, and said, \\'I suppose you do.\\'\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter Seventeen\\n\\n\\'You\\'re a lucky girl today.\\'\\n\\nThe young nurse cleared my breakfast tray away and left me wrapped in\\nmy white blanket like a passenger taking the sea air on the deck of a\\nship.\\n\\n\\'Why am I lucky?\\'\\n\\n\\'Well, I\\'m not sure if you\\'re supposed to know yet, but today you\\'re\\nmoving to Belsize.\\'  The nurse looked at me expectantly.\\n\\n\\'Belsize,\\' I said.  \\'I can\\'t go there.\\'\\n\\n\\'Why not?\\'\\n\\n\\'I\\'m not ready.  I\\'m not well enough.\\'\\n\\n\\'Of course, you\\'re well enough.  Don\\'t worry, they wouldn\\'t be moving\\nyou if you weren\\'t well enough.\\'\\n\\nAfter the nurse left, I tried to puzzle out this new move on Doctor\\nNolan\\'s part.  What was she trying to prove?  I hadn\\'t changed.\\nNothing had changed.  And Belsize was the best house of all.  From\\nBelsize people went back to work and back to school and back to their\\nhomes.\\n\\nJoan would be at Belsize.  Joan with her physics books and her golf\\nclubs and her badminton rackets and her breathy voice.  Joan, marking\\nthe gulf between me and the nearly well ones.  Ever since Joan left\\nCaplan I\\'d followed her progress through the asylum grapevine.\\n\\nJoan had walk privileges, Joan had shopping privileges, Joan had town\\nprivileges.  I gathered all my news of Joan into a little, bitter heap,\\nthough I received it with surface gladness.  Joan was the beaming\\ndouble of my old best self, specially designed to follow and torment me.\\n\\nPerhaps Joan would be gone when I got to Belsize.\\n\\nAt least at Belsize I could forget about shock treatments.  At Caplan a\\nlot of the women had shock treatments.  I could tell which ones they\\nwere, because they didn\\'t get their breakfast trays with the rest of\\nus.  They had their shock treatments while we breakfasted in our rooms,\\nand then they came into the lounge, quiet and extinguished, led like\\nchildren by the nurses, and ate their breakfasts there.\\n\\nEach morning, when I heard the nurse knock with my tray, an immense\\nrelief flooded through me, because I knew I was out of danger for that\\nday.  I didn\\'t see how Doctor Nolan could tell you went to sleep during\\na shock treatment if she\\'d never had a shock treatment herself.  How\\ndid she know the person didn\\'t just _look_ as if he was asleep, while\\nall the time, inside, he was feeling the blue volts and the noise?\\n\\n\\nPiano music sounded from the end of the hall.\\n\\nAt supper I had sat quietly, listening to the chatter of the Belsize\\nwomen.  They were all fashionably dressed and carefully made up, and\\nseveral of them were married.  Some of them had been shopping downtown,\\nand others had been out visiting with friends, and all during supper\\nthey kept tossing back and forth these private jokes.\\n\\n\\'I\\'d call Jack,\\' a woman named DeeDee said, \\'only I\\'m afraid he\\nwouldn\\'t be home.  I know just where I could call him, though, and he\\'d\\nbe in, all right.\\'\\n\\nThe short, spry blonde woman at my table laughed.  \\'I almost had Doctor\\nLoring where I wanted him today.\\'  She widened her starey blue eyes\\nlike a little doll.  \\'I wouldn\\'t mind trading old Percy in for a new\\nmodel.\\'\\n\\nAt the opposite end of the room, Joan was wolfing her spam and broiled\\ntomato with great appetite.  She seemed perfectly at home among these\\nwomen and treated me coolly, with a slight sneer, like a dim and\\ninferior acquaintance.\\n\\nI had gone to bed right after supper, but then I heard the piano music\\nand pictured Joan and DeeDee and Loubelle, the blonde woman, and the\\nrest of them, laughing and gossiping about me in the living room behind\\nmy back.  They would be saying how awful it was to have people like me\\nin Belsize and that I should be in Wymark instead.\\n\\nI decided to put a lid on their nasty talk.\\n\\nDraping my blanket loosely around my shoulders, like a stole, I\\nwandered down the hall toward the light and the gay noise.\\n\\nFor the rest of the evening I listened to DeeDee thump out some of her\\nown songs on the grand piano, while the other women sat round playing\\nbridge and chatting, just the way they would in a college dormitory,\\nonly most of them were ten years over college age.\\n\\nOne of them, a great, tall, grey-haired woman with a booming bass\\nvoice, named Mrs Savage, had gone to Vassar.  I could tell right away\\nshe was a society woman, because she talked about nothing but\\ndébutantes.  It seemed she had two or three daughters, and that year\\nthey were all going to be débutantes, only she had loused up their\\ndébutante party by signing herself into the asylum.\\n\\nDeeDee had one song she called \\'The Milkman\\' and everybody kept saying\\nshe ought to get it published, it would be a hit.  First her hands\\nwould clop out a little melody on the keys, like the hoofbeats of a\\nslow pony, and next another melody came in, like the milkman whistling,\\nand then the two melodies went on together.\\n\\n\\'That\\'s very nice,\\' I said in a conversational voice.\\n\\nJoan was leaning on one corner of the piano and leafing through a new\\nissue of some fashion magazine, and DeeDee smiled up at her as if the\\ntwo of them shared a secret.\\n\\n\\'Oh, Esther,\\' Joan said then, holding up the magazine, \\'isn\\'t this you?\\'\\n\\nDeeDee stopped playing.  \\'Let me see.\\'  She took the magazine, peered\\nat the page Joan pointed to, and then glanced back at me.\\n\\n\\'Oh no,\\' DeeDee said.  \\'Surely not.\\'  She looked at the magazine again,\\nthen at me.  \\'Never!\\'\\n\\n\\'Oh, but it _is_ Esther, isn\\'t it Esther?\\' Joan said.\\n\\nLoubelle and Mrs Savage drifted over, and pretending I knew what it was\\nall about, I moved to the piano with them.\\n\\nThe magazine photograph showed a girl in a strapless evening dress of\\nfuzzy white stuff, grinning fit to split, with a whole lot of boys\\nbending in around her.  The girl was holding a glass full of a\\ntransparent drink and seemed to have her eyes fixed over my shoulder on\\nsomething that stood behind me, a little to my left.  A faint breath\\nfanned the back of my neck.  I wheeled round.\\n\\nThe night nurse had come in, unnoticed, on her soft rubber soles.\\n\\n\\'No kidding,\\' she said, \\'is that really you?\\'\\n\\n\\'No, it\\'s not me.  Joan\\'s quite mistaken.  It\\'s somebody else.\\'\\n\\n\\'Oh, say it\\'s you!\\' DeeDee cried.\\n\\nBut I pretended I didn\\'t hear her and turned away.\\n\\nThen Loubelle begged the nurse to make a fourth at bridge, and I drew\\nup a chair to watch, although I didn\\'t know the first thing about\\nbridge, because I hadn\\'t had time to pick it up at college, the way all\\nthe wealthy girls did.\\n\\nI stared at the flat poker-faces of the kings and jacks and queens and\\nlistened to the nurse talking about her hard life.\\n\\n\\'You ladies don\\'t know what it is, holding down two jobs,\\' she said.\\n\\'Nights I\\'m over here, watching you....\\'\\n\\nLoubelle giggled.  \\'Oh, we\\'re good.  We\\'re the best of the lot, and you\\nknow it.\\'\\n\\n\\'Oh, _you\\'re_ all right.\\'  The nurse passed round a packet of spearmint\\ngum, then unfolded a pink strap from its tinfoil wrapper herself.\\n\\'_You\\'re_ all right, it\\'s those boobies at the state place that worry\\nme off my feet.\\'\\n\\n\\'Do you work in both places then?\\' I asked with sudden interest.\\n\\n\\'You bet.\\'  The nurse gave me a straight look, and I could see she\\nthought I had no business in Belsize at all.  \\'You wouldn\\'t like it\\nover there one bit, Lady Jane.\\'\\n\\nI found it strange that the nurse should call me Lady Jane when she\\nknew what my name was perfectly well.\\n\\n\\'Why?\\' I persisted.\\n\\n\\'Oh, it\\'s not a nice place, like this.  This is a regular country club.\\nOver there they\\'ve got nothing.  No OT to talk of, no walks....\\'\\n\\n\\'Why haven\\'t they got walks?\\'\\n\\n\\'Not enough em-ploy-ees.\\'  The nurse scooped in a trick and Loubelle\\ngroaned.  \\'Believe me, ladies, when I collect enough do-re-mi to buy me\\na car, I\\'m clearing out.\\'\\n\\n\\'Will you clear out of here, too?\\' Joan wanted to know.\\n\\n\\'You bet.  Only private cases from then on.  When I feel like it....\\'\\n\\nBut I\\'d stopped listening.\\n\\nI felt the nurse had been instructed to show me my alternatives.\\nEither I got better, or I fell, down, down, like a burning, then\\nburnt-out star, from Belsize, to Caplan, to Wymark and finally, after\\nDoctor Nolan and Mrs Guinea had given me up, to the state place\\nnext-door.\\n\\nI gathered my blanket round me and pushed back my chair.\\n\\n\\'You cold?\\' the nurse demanded rudely.\\n\\n\\'Yes,\\' I said, moving off down the hall.  \\'I\\'m frozen stiff.\\'\\n\\n\\nI woke warm and placid in my white cocoon.  A shaft of pale, wintry\\nsunlight dazzled the mirror and the glasses on the bureau and the metal\\ndoorknobs.  From across the hall came the early morning clatter of the\\nmaids in the kitchen, preparing the breakfast trays.\\n\\nI heard the nurse knock on the door next to mine, at the far end of the\\nhall.  Mrs Savage\\'s sleepy voice boomed out, and the nurse went into\\nher with the jingling tray.  I thought, with a mild stir of pleasure,\\nof the steaming blue china coffee pitcher and the blue china breakfast\\ncup and the fat blue china cream jug with the white daisies on it.\\n\\nI was beginning to resign myself.\\n\\nIf I was going to fall, I would hang on to my small comforts, at least,\\nas long as I possibly could.\\n\\nThe nurse rapped on my door and, without waiting for an answer, breezed\\nin.\\n\\nIt was a new nurse--they were always changing--with a lean,\\nsand-coloured face and sandy hair, and large freckles polka-dotting her\\nbony nose.  For some reason the sight of this nurse made me sick at\\nheart, and it was only as she strode across the room to snap up the\\ngreen blind that I realized part of her strangeness came from being\\nempty-handed.\\n\\nI opened my mouth to ask for my breakfast tray, but silenced myself\\nimmediately.  The nurse would be mistaking me for somebody else.  New\\nnurses often did that.  Somebody in Belsize must be having shock\\ntreatments, unknown to me, and the nurse had, quite understandably,\\nconfused me with her.\\n\\nI waited until the nurse had made her little circuit of my room,\\npatting, straightening, arranging, and taken the next tray in to\\nLoubelle one door farther down the hall.\\n\\nThen I shoved my feet into my slippers, dragging my blanket with me,\\nfor the morning was bright, but very cold, and crossed quickly to the\\nkitchen.  The pink-uniformed maid was filling a row of blue china\\ncoffee pitchers from a great, battered kettle on the stove.\\n\\nI looked with love at the line-up of waiting trays--the white paper\\nnapkins, folded in their crisp, isosceles triangles, each under the\\nanchor of its silver fork, the pale domes of the soft-boiled eggs in\\nthe blue egg cups, the scalloped glass shells of orange marmalade.  All\\nI had to do was reach out and claim my tray, and the world would be\\nperfectly normal.\\n\\n\\'There\\'s been a mistake,\\' I told the maid, leaning over the counter and\\nspeaking in a low, confidential tone.  \\'The new nurse forgot to bring\\nin my breakfast tray today.\\'\\n\\nI managed a bright smile, to show there were no hard feelings.\\n\\n\\'What\\'s the name?\\'\\n\\n\\'Greenwood.  Esther Greenwood.\\'\\n\\n\\'Greenwood, Greenwood, Greenwood.\\'  The maid\\'s warty index finger slid\\ndown the list of names of the patients in Belsize tacked up on the\\nkitchen wall.  \\'Greenwood, no breakfast today.\\'\\n\\nI caught the rim of the counter with both hands.\\n\\n\\'There must be a mistake.  Are you sure it\\'s Greenwood?\\'\\n\\n\\'Greenwood,\\' the maid said decisively as the nurse came in.\\n\\nThe nurse looked questioningly from me to the maid.\\n\\n\\'Miss Greenwood wanted her tray,\\' the maid said, avoiding my eyes.\\n\\n\\'Oh,\\' the nurse smiled at me, \\'you\\'ll be getting your tray later on\\nthis morning, Miss Greenwood.  You...\\'\\n\\nBut I didn\\'t wait to hear what the nurse said.  I strode blindly out\\ninto the hall, not to my room, because that was where they would come\\nto get me, but to the alcove, greatly inferior to the alcove at Caplan,\\nbut an alcove, nevertheless, in a quiet corner of the hall, where Joan\\nand Loubelle and DeeDee and Mrs Savage would not come.\\n\\nI curled up in the far corner of the alcove with the blanket over my\\nhead.  It wasn\\'t the shock treatment that struck me, so much as the\\nbare-faced treachery of Doctor Nolan.  I liked Doctor Nolan, I loved\\nher, I had given her my trust on a platter and told her everything, and\\nshe had promised, faithfully, to warn me ahead of time if ever I had to\\nhave another shock treatment.\\n\\nIf she had told me the night before I would have lain awake all night,\\nof course, full of dread and foreboding, but by morning I would have\\nbeen composed and ready.  I would have gone down the hall between two\\nnurses, past DeeDee and Loubelle and Mrs Savage and Joan, with dignity,\\nlike a person coolly resigned to execution.\\n\\nThe nurse bent over me and called my name.\\n\\nI pulled away and crouched farther into the corner.  The nurse\\ndisappeared.  I knew she would return, in a minute, with two burly men\\nattendants, and they would bear me, howling and hitting, past the\\nsmiling audience now gathered in the lounge.\\n\\nDoctor Nolan put her arm around me and hugged me like a mother.\\n\\n\\'You said you\\'d _tell_ me!\\' I shouted at her through the dishevelled\\nblanket.\\n\\n\\'But I _am_ telling you,\\' Doctor Nolan said.  \\'I\\'ve come specially\\nearly to tell you, and I\\'m taking you over myself.\\'\\n\\nI peered at her through swollen lids.  \\'Why didn\\'t you tell me last\\nnight?\\'\\n\\n\\'I only thought it would keep you awake.  If I\\'d known...\\'\\n\\n\\'You _said_ you\\'d tell me.\\'\\n\\n\\'Listen, Esther,\\' Doctor Nolan said.  \\'I\\'m going over with you.  I\\'ll\\nbe there the whole time, so everything will happen right, the way I\\npromised.  I\\'ll be there when you wake up, and I\\'ll bring you back\\nagain.\\'\\n\\nI looked at her.  She seemed very upset.\\n\\nI waited a minute.  Then I said, \\'Promise you\\'ll be there.\\'\\n\\n\\'I promise.\\'\\n\\nDoctor Nolan took out a white handkerchief and wiped my face.  Then she\\nhooked her arm in my arm, like an old friend, and helped me up, and we\\nstarted down the hall.  My blanket tangled about my feet, so I let it\\ndrop, but Doctor Nolan didn\\'t seem to notice.  We passed Joan, coming\\nout of her room, and I gave her a meaning, disdainful smile, and she\\nducked back and waited until we had gone by.\\n\\nThen Doctor Nolan unlocked a door at the end of the hall and led me\\ndown a flight of stairs into the mysterious basement corridors that\\nlinked, in an elaborate network of tunnels and burrows, all the various\\nbuildings of the hospital.\\n\\nThe walls were bright, white lavatory tile with bald bulbs set at\\nintervals in the black ceiling.  Stretchers and wheelchairs were\\nbeached here and there against the hissing, knocking pipes that ran and\\nbranched in an intricate nervous system along the glittering walls.  I\\nhung on to Doctor Nolan\\'s arm like death, and every so often she gave\\nme an encouraging squeeze.\\n\\nFinally, we stopped at a green door with Electrotherapy printed on it\\nin black letters.  I held back, and Doctor Nolan waited.  Then I said,\\n\\'Let\\'s get it over with,\\' and we went in.\\n\\nThe only people in the waiting-room beside Doctor Nolan and me were a\\npallid man in a shabby maroon bathrobe and his accompanying nurse.\\n\\n\\'Do you want to sit down?\\'  Doctor Nolan pointed at a wooden bench, but\\nmy legs felt full of heaviness, and I thought how hard it would be to\\nhoist myself from a sitting position when the shock treatment people\\ncame in.\\n\\n\\'I\\'d rather stand.\\'\\n\\nAt last a tall, cadaverous woman in a white smock entered the room from\\nan inner door.  I thought that she would go up and take the man in the\\nmaroon bathrobe, as he was first, so I was surprised when she came\\ntowards me.\\n\\n\\'Good morning, Doctor Nolan,\\' the woman said, putting her arm around my\\nshoulders.  \\'Is this Esther?\\'\\n\\n\\'Yes, Miss Huey.  Esther, this is Miss Huey, she\\'ll take good care of\\nyou.  I\\'ve told her about you.\\'\\n\\nI thought the woman must be seven feet tall.  She bent over me in a\\nkind way, and I could see that her face, with the buck teeth protruding\\nin the centre, had at one time been badly pitted with acne.  It looked\\nlike maps of the craters on the moon.\\n\\n\\'I think we can take you right away, Esther,\\' Miss Huey said.\\n\\n\\'Mr Anderson won\\'t mind waiting, will you, Mr Anderson?\\'\\n\\nMr Anderson didn\\'t say a word, so with Miss Huey\\'s arm around my\\nshoulder, and Doctor Nolan following, I moved into the next room.\\n\\nThrough the slits of my eyes, which I didn\\'t dare open too far, lest\\nthe full view strike me dead, I saw the high bed with its white,\\ndrumtight sheet, and the machine behind the bed, and the masked\\nperson--I couldn\\'t tell whether it was a man or a woman--behind the\\nmachine, and other masked people flanking the bed on both sides.\\n\\nMiss Huey helped me climb up and lie down on my back.\\n\\n\\'Talk to me,\\' I said.\\n\\nMiss Huey began to talk in a low, soothing voice, smoothing the salve\\non my temples and fitting the small electric buttons on either side of\\nmy head.  \\'You\\'ll be perfectly all right, you won\\'t feel a thing, just\\nbite down....\\'  And she set something on my tongue and in panic I bit\\ndown, and darkness wiped me out like chalk on a blackboard.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter Eighteen\\n\\n\\'Esther.\\'\\n\\nI woke out of a deep, drenched sleep, and the first thing I saw was\\nDoctor Nolan\\'s face swimming in front of me and saying, \\'Esther,\\nEsther.\\'\\n\\nI rubbed my eyes with an awkward hand.\\n\\nBehind Doctor Nolan I could see the body of a woman wearing a rumpled\\nblack-and-white checked robe and flung out on a cot as if dropped from\\na great height.  But before I could take in any more, Doctor Nolan led\\nme through a door into fresh, blue-skied air.\\n\\nAll the heat and fear had purged itself.  I felt surprisingly at peace.\\nThe bell jar hung, suspended, a few feet above my head.  I was open to\\nthe circulating air.\\n\\n\\'It was like I told you it would be, wasn\\'t it?\\' said Doctor Nolan, as\\nwe walked back to Belsize together through the crunch of brown leaves.\\n\\n\\'Yes.\\'\\n\\n\\'Well it will always be like that,\\' she said firmly.  \\'You will be\\nhaving shock treatments three times a week--Tuesday, Thursday and\\nSaturday.\\'\\n\\nI gulped in a long draught of air.\\n\\n\\'For how long?\\'\\n\\n\\'That depends,\\' Doctor Nolan said, \\'on you and me.\\'\\n\\n\\nI took up the silver knife and cracked off the cap of my egg.  Then I\\nput down the knife and looked at it.  I tried to think what I had loved\\nknives for, but my mind slipped from the noose of the thought and\\nswung, like a bird, in the centre of empty air.\\n\\nJoan and DeeDee were sitting side by side on the piano bench, and\\nDeeDee was teaching Joan to play the bottom half of Chopsticks while\\nshe played the top.\\n\\nI thought how sad it was Joan looked so horsey, with such big teeth and\\neyes like two grey, goggly pebbles.  Why, she couldn\\'t even keep a boy\\nlike Buddy Willard.  And DeeDee\\'s husband was obviously living with\\nsome mistress or other and turning her sour as an old fusty cat.\\n\\n\\n\\'I\\'ve got a let-ter,\\' Joan chanted, poking her tousled head inside my\\ndoor.\\n\\n\\'Good for you.\\'  I kept my eyes on my book.  Ever since the shock\\ntreatments had ended, after a brief series of five, and I had town\\nprivileges, Joan hung about me like a large and breathless fruitfly--as\\nif the sweetness of recovery were something she could suck up by mere\\nnearness.  They had taken away her physics books and the piles of dusty\\nspiral pads full of lecture notes that had ringed her room, and she was\\nconfined to grounds again.\\n\\n\\'Don\\'t you want to know who it\\'s _from_?\\'\\n\\nJoan edged into the room and sat down on my bed.  I wanted to tell her\\nto get the hell out, she gave me the creeps, only I couldn\\'t do it.\\n\\n\\'All right.\\'  I stuck my finger in my place and shut the book.  \\'Who\\nfrom?\\'\\n\\nJoan slipped out a pale blue envelope from her skirt pocket and waved\\nit teasingly.\\n\\n\\'Well isn\\'t that a coincidence!\\' I said.\\n\\n\\'What do you mean, a coincidence?\\'\\n\\nI went over to my bureau, picked up a pale blue envelope and waved it\\nat Joan like a parting handkerchief.  \\'I got a letter too.  I wonder if\\nthey\\'re the same.\\'\\n\\n\\'He\\'s better,\\' Joan said.  \\'He\\'s out of hospital.\\'\\n\\nThere was a little pause.\\n\\n\\'Are you going to marry him?\\'\\n\\n\\'No,\\' I said.  \\'Are you?\\'\\n\\nJoan grinned evasively.  \\'I didn\\'t like him much, anyway.\\'\\n\\n\\'Oh?\\'\\n\\n\\'No, it was his family I liked.\\'\\n\\n\\'You mean Mr and Mrs Willard?\\'\\n\\n\\'Yes,\\' Joan\\'s voice slid down my spine like a draft.  \\'I loved them.\\nThey were so nice, so happy, nothing like my parents.  I went over to\\nsee them all the time;\\' she paused, \\'until you came.\\'\\n\\n\\'I\\'m sorry.\\'  Then I added, \\'Why didn\\'t you go on seeing them, if you\\nliked them so much?\\'\\n\\n\\'Oh, I couldn\\'t,\\' Joan said.  \\'Not with you dating Buddy.  It would\\nhave looked ... I don\\'t _know_, funny.\\'\\n\\nI considered.  \\'I suppose so.\\'\\n\\n\\'Are you,\\' Joan hesitated, \\'going to let him come?\\'\\n\\n\\'I don\\'t know.\\'\\n\\nAt first I had thought it would be awful having Buddy come and visit me\\nat the asylum--he would probably only come to gloat and hob-nob with\\nthe other doctors.  But then it seemed to me it would be a step,\\nplacing him, renouncing him, in spite of the fact that I had\\nnobody--telling him there was no simultaneous interpreter, nobody, but\\nthat he was the wrong one, that I had stopped hanging on.  \\'Are you?\\'\\n\\n\\'Yes,\\' Joan breathed.  \\'Maybe he\\'ll bring his mother.  I\\'m going to ask\\nhim to bring his mother....\\'\\n\\n\\'His _mother_?\\'\\n\\nJoan pouted.  \\'I like Mrs Willard.  Mrs Willard\\'s a wonderful,\\nwonderful woman.  She\\'s been a real mother to me.\\'\\n\\nI had a picture of Mrs Willard, with her heather-mixture tweeds and her\\nsensible shoes and her wise, maternal maxims.  Mr Willard was her\\nlittle boy, and his voice was high and clear, like a little boy\\'s.\\nJoan and Mrs Willard.  Joan ... and Mrs Willard...\\n\\nI had knocked on DeeDee\\'s door that morning, wanting to borrow some\\ntwo-part sheet music.  I waited a few minutes and then, hearing no\\nanswer and thinking DeeDee must be out, and I could pick up the music\\nfrom her bureau, I pushed the door open and stepped into the room.\\n\\nAt Belsize, even at Belsize, the doors had locks, but the patients had\\nno keys.  A shut door meant privacy, and was respected, like a locked\\ndoor.  One knocked, and knocked again, then went away.  I remembered\\nthis as I stood, my eyes half-useless after the brilliance of the hall,\\nin the room\\'s deep, musky dark.\\n\\nAs my vision cleared, I saw a shape rise from the bed.  Then somebody\\ngave a low giggle.  The shape adjusted its hair, and two pale, pebble\\neyes regarded me through the gloom.  DeeDee lay back on the pillows,\\nbare-legged under her green wool dressing-gown, and watched me with a\\nlittle mocking smile.  A cigarette glowed between the fingers of her\\nright hand.\\n\\n\\'I just wanted...\\' I said.\\n\\n\\'I know,\\' said DeeDee.  \\'The music.\\'\\n\\n\\'Hello, Esther,\\' Joan said then, and her cornhusk voice made me want to\\npuke.  \\'Wait for me, Esther, I\\'ll come play the bottom part with you.\\'\\n\\nNow Joan said stoutly, \\'I never really liked Buddy Willard.  He thought\\nhe knew everything.  He thought he knew everything about women....\\'\\n\\nI looked at Joan.  In spite of the creepy feeling, and in spite of my\\nold, ingrained dislike, Joan fascinated me.  It was like observing a\\nMartian, or a particularly warty toad.  Her thoughts were not my\\nthoughts, nor her feelings my feelings, but we were close enough so\\nthat her thoughts and feelings seemed a wry, black image of my own.\\n\\nSometimes I wondered if I had made Joan up.  Other times I wondered if\\nshe would continue to pop in at every crisis of my life to remind me of\\nwhat I had been, and what I had been through, and carry on her own\\nseparate but similar crisis under my nose.\\n\\n\\'I don\\'t see what women see in other women,\\' I\\'d told Doctor Nolan in\\nmy interview that noon.  \\'What does a woman see in a woman that she\\ncan\\'t see in a man?\\'\\n\\nDoctor Nolan paused.  Then she said, \\'Tenderness.\\'\\n\\nThat shut me up.\\n\\n\\'I like you,\\' Joan was saying.  \\'I like you better than Buddy.\\'\\n\\nAnd as she stretched out on my bed with a silly smile, I remembered a\\nminor scandal at our college dormitory when a fat, matronly-breasted\\nsenior, homely as a grandmother and a pious Religion major, and a tall,\\ngawky freshman with a history of being deserted at an early hour in all\\nsorts of ingenious ways by her blind dates, started seeing too much of\\neach other.  They were always together, and once somebody had come upon\\nthem embracing, the story went, in the fat girl\\'s room.\\n\\n\\'But what were they _doing_?\\' I had asked.  Whenever I thought about\\nmen and men, and women and women, I could never really imagine what\\nthey would be actually doing.\\n\\n\\'Oh,\\' the spy had said, \\'Milly was sitting on the chair and Theodora\\nwas lying on the bed, and Milly was stroking Theodora\\'s hair.\\'\\n\\nI was disappointed.  I had thought I would have some revelation of\\nspecific evil.  I wondered if all women did with other women was lie\\nand hug.\\n\\nOf course, the famous woman poet at my college lived with another\\nwoman--a stumpy old Classical scholar with a cropped Dutch cut.  And\\nwhen I had told the poet I might well get married and have a pack of\\nchildren some day, she stared at me in horror.  \\'But what about your\\n_career_?\\' she had cried.\\n\\nMy head ached.  Why did I attract these weird old women?  There was the\\nfamous poet, and Philomena Guinea, and Jay Cee, and the Christian\\nScientist lady and lord knows who, and they all wanted to adopt me in\\nsome way, and, for the price of their care and influence, have me\\nresemble them.\\n\\n\\'I like you.\\'\\n\\n\\'That\\'s tough, Joan,\\' I said, picking up my book.  \\'Because I don\\'t\\nlike you.  You make me puke, if you want to know.\\'\\n\\nAnd I walked out of the room, leaving Joan lying, lumpy as an old\\nhorse, across my bed.\\n\\n\\nI waited for the doctor, wondering if I should bolt.  I knew what I was\\ndoing was illegal--in Massachusetts, anyway, because the state was\\ncram-jam full of Catholics--but Doctor Nolan said this doctor was an\\nold friend of hers, and a wise man.\\n\\n\\'What\\'s your appointment for?\\' the brisk, white-uniformed receptionist\\nwanted to know, ticking my name off on a notebook list.\\n\\n\\'What do you mean, _for_?\\'  I hadn\\'t thought anybody but the doctor\\nhimself would ask me that, and the communal waiting-room was full of\\nother patients waiting for other doctors, most of them pregnant or with\\nbabies, and I felt their eyes on my flat, virgin stomach.\\n\\nThe receptionist glanced up at me, and I blushed.\\n\\n\\'A fitting, isn\\'t it?\\' she said kindly.  \\'I only wanted to make sure so\\nI\\'d know what to charge you.  Are you a student?\\'\\n\\n\\'Ye-es.\\'\\n\\n\\'That will only be half-price then.  Five dollars, instead of ten.\\nShall I bill you?\\'\\n\\nI was about to give my home address, where I would probably be by the\\ntime the bill arrived, but then I thought of my mother opening the bill\\nand seeing what it was for.  The only other address I had was the\\ninnocuous box number which people used who didn\\'t want to advertise the\\nfact they lived in an asylum.  But I thought the receptionist might\\nrecognize the box number, so I said, \\'I better pay now,\\' and peeled\\nfive dollar notes off the roll in my pocketbook.\\n\\nThe five dollars was part of what Philomena Guinea had sent me as a\\nsort of get-well present.  I wondered what she would think if she knew\\nto what use her money was being put.\\n\\nWhether she knew it or not, Philomena Guinea was buying my freedom.\\n\\n\\'What I hate is the thought of being under a man\\'s thumb,\\' I had told\\nDoctor Nolan.  \\'A man doesn\\'t have a worry in the world, while I\\'ve got\\na baby hanging over my head like a big stick, to keep me in line.\\'\\n\\n\\'Would you act differently if you didn\\'t have to worry about a baby?\\'\\n\\n\\'Yes,\\' I said, \\'but...\\' and I told Doctor Nolan about the married woman\\nlawyer and her Defence of Chastity.\\n\\nDoctor Nolan waited until I was finished.  Then she burst out laughing.\\n\\'Propaganda!\\' she said, and scribbled the name and address of this\\ndoctor on a prescription pad.\\n\\nI leafed nervously through an issue of _Baby Talk_.  The fat, bright\\nfaces of babies beamed up at me, page after page--bald babies,\\nchocolate-coloured babies, Eisenhower-faced babies, babies rolling over\\nfor the first time, babies reaching for rattles, babies eating their\\nfirst spoonful of solid food, babies doing all the little tricky things\\nit takes to grow up, step by step, into an anxious and unsettling world.\\n\\nI smelt a mingling of Pabulum and sour milk and salt-cod-stinky diapers\\nand felt sorrowful and tender.  How easy having babies seemed to the\\nwomen around me!  Why was I so unmaternal and apart?  Why couldn\\'t I\\ndream of devoting myself to baby after fat puling baby like Dodo Conway?\\n\\nIf I had to wait on a baby all day, I would go mad.\\n\\nI looked at the baby in the lap of the woman opposite.  I had no idea\\nhow old it was, I never did, with babies--for all I knew it could talk\\na blue streak and had twenty teeth behind its pursed, pink lips.  It\\nheld its little wobbly head up on its shoulders--it didn\\'t seem to have\\na neck--and observed me with a wise, Platonic expression.\\n\\nThe baby\\'s mother smiled and smiled, holding that baby as if it were\\nthe first wonder of the world.  I watched the mother and the baby for\\nsome clue to their mutual satisfaction, but before I had discovered\\nanything, the doctor called me in.\\n\\n\\'You\\'d like a fitting,\\' he said cheerfully, and I thought with relief\\nthat he wasn\\'t the sort of doctor to ask awkward questions.  I had\\ntoyed with the idea of telling him I planned to be married to a sailor\\nas soon as his ship docked at the Charlestown Navy Yard, and the reason\\nI didn\\'t have an engagement ring was because we were too poor, but at\\nthe last moment I rejected that appealing story and simply said \\'Yes\\'.\\n\\nI climbed up on the examination table, thinking: \\'I am climbing to\\nfreedom, freedom from fear, freedom from marrying the wrong person,\\nlike Buddy Willard, just because of sex, freedom from the Florence\\nCrittenden Homes where all the poor girls go who should have been\\nfitted out like me, because what they did, they would do anyway,\\nregardless...\\'\\n\\nAs I rode back to the asylum with my box in the plain brown paper\\nwrapper on my lap I might have been Mrs Anybody coming back from a day\\nin town with a Schrafft\\'s cake for her maiden aunt or a Filene\\'s\\nBasement hat.  Gradually the suspicion that Catholics had X-ray eyes\\ndiminished, and I grew easy.  I had done well by my shopping\\nprivileges, I thought.\\n\\nI was my own woman.\\n\\nThe next step was to find the proper sort of man.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter Nineteen\\n\\n\\'I\\'m going to be a psychiatrist.\\'\\n\\nJoan spoke with her usual breathy enthusiasm.  We were drinking apple\\ncider in the Belsize lounge.\\n\\n\\'Oh,\\' I said dryly, \\'that\\'s nice.\\'\\n\\n\\'I\\'ve had a long talk with Doctor Quinn, and she thinks it\\'s perfectly\\npossible.\\'  Doctor Quinn was Joan\\'s psychiatrist, a bright, shrewd,\\nsingle lady, and I often thought if I had been assigned to Doctor Quinn\\nI would be still in Caplan or, more probably, Wymark.  Doctor Quinn had\\nan abstract quality that appealed to Joan, but it gave me the polar\\nchills.\\n\\nJoan chattered on about Egos and Ids, and I turned my mind to something\\nelse, to the brown, unwrapped package in my bottom drawer.  I never\\ntalked about Egos and Ids with Doctor Nolan.  I didn\\'t know just what I\\ntalked about, really.\\n\\n\\'... I\\'m going to live out, now.\\'\\n\\nI tuned in on Joan then.  \\'Where?\\' I demanded, trying to hide my envy.\\n\\nDoctor Nolan said my college would take me back for the second\\nsemester, on her recommendation and Philomena Guinea\\'s scholarship, but\\nas the doctors vetoed my living with my mother in the interim, I was\\nstaying on at the asylum until the winter term began.\\n\\nEven so, I felt it unfair of Joan to beat me through the gates.\\n\\n\\'Where?\\' I persisted.  \\'They\\'re not letting you live on your own, are\\nthey?\\'  Joan had only that week been given town privileges again.\\n\\n\\'Oh no, of course not.  I\\'m living in Cambridge with Nurse Kennedy.\\nHer room-mate\\'s just got married, and she needs someone to share the\\napartment.\\'\\n\\n\\'Cheers.\\'  I raised my apple cider glass, and we clinked.  In spite of\\nmy profound reservations, I thought I would always treasure Joan.  It\\nwas as if we had been forced together by some overwhelming\\ncircumstance, like war or plague, and shared a world of our own.  \\'When\\nare you leaving?\\'\\n\\n\\'On the first of the month.\\'\\n\\n\\'Nice.\\'\\n\\nJoan grew wistful.  \\'You\\'ll come visit me, won\\'t you, Esther?\\'\\n\\n\\'Of course.\\'\\n\\nBut I thought, \\'Not likely.\\'\\n\\n\\n\\'It hurts,\\' I said.  \\'Is it supposed to hurt?\\'\\n\\nIrwin didn\\'t say anything.  Then he said, \\'Sometimes it hurts.\\'\\n\\nI had met Irwin on the steps of the Widener Library.  I was standing at\\nthe top of the long flight, overlooking the red brick buildings that\\nwalled the snow-filled quad and preparing to catch the trolley back to\\nthe asylum, when a tall young man with a rather ugly and bespectacled,\\nbut intelligent face, came up and said, \\'Could you please tell me the\\ntime?\\'\\n\\nI glanced at my watch.  \\'Five past four.\\'\\n\\nThen the man shifted his arms around the load of books he was carrying\\nbefore him like a dinner tray and revealed a bony wrist.\\n\\n\\'Why, you\\'ve a watch yourself!\\'\\n\\nThe man looked ruefully at his watch.  He lifted it and shook it by his\\near.  \\'Doesn\\'t work.\\' He smiled engagingly.  \\'Where are you going?\\'\\n\\nI was about to say, \\'Back to the asylum\\', but the man looked promising,\\nso I changed my mind.  \\'Home.\\'\\n\\n\\'Would you like some coffee first?\\'\\n\\nI hesitated.  I was due at the asylum for supper and I didn\\'t want to\\nbe late so close to being signed out of there for good.\\n\\n\\'A very _small_ cup of coffee?\\'\\n\\nI decided to practise my new, normal personality on this man who, in\\nthe course of my hesitations, told me his name was Irwin and that he\\nwas a very well-paid professor of mathematics, so I said, \\'All right,\\'\\nand, matching my stride to Irwin\\'s, strolled down the long,\\nice-encrusted flight at his side.\\n\\nIt was only after seeing Irwin\\'s study that I decided to seduce him.\\n\\nIrwin lived in a murky, comfortable basement apartment in one of the\\nrundown streets of outer Cambridge and drove me there--for a beer, he\\nsaid--after three cups of bitter coffee in a student cafe.  We sat in\\nhis study on stuffed brown leather chairs, surrounded by stacks of\\ndusty, incomprehensible books with huge formulas inset artistically on\\nthe page like poems.\\n\\nWhile I was sipping my first glass of beer--I have never really cared\\nfor cold beer in mid-winter, but I accepted the glass to have something\\nsolid to hold on to--the doorbell rang.\\n\\nIrwin seemed embarrassed.  \\'I think it may be a lady.\\'\\n\\nIrwin had a queer, old-world habit of calling women ladies.\\n\\n\\'Fine, fine,\\' I gestured largely.  \\'Bring her in.\\'\\n\\nIrwin shook his head.  \\'You would upset her.\\'\\n\\nI smiled into my amber cylinder of cold beer.\\n\\nThe doorbell rang again with a peremptory jab.  Irwin sighed and rose\\nto answer it.  The minute he disappeared, I whipped into the bathroom\\nand, concealed behind the dirty, aluminium-coloured Venetian blind,\\nwatched Irwin\\'s monkish face appear in the door crack.\\n\\nA large, bosomy Slavic lady in a bulky sweater of natural sheep\\'s wool,\\npurple slacks, high-heeled black overshoes with Persian lamb cuffs and\\na matching toque, puffed white, inaudible words into the wintry air.\\nIrwin\\'s voice drifted back to me through the chilly hall.\\n\\n\\'I\\'m sorry, Olga ... I\\'m working, Olga ... no, I don\\'t think so, Olga,\\'\\nall the while the lady\\'s red mouth moved, and the words, translated to\\nwhite smoke, floated up among the branches of the naked Mac by the\\ndoor.  Then, finally, \\'Perhaps, Olga ... good-bye, Olga.\\'\\n\\nI admired the immense, steppe-like expanse of the lady\\'s wool-clad\\nbosom as she retreated, a few inches from my eye, down the creaking\\nwooden stair, a sort of Siberian bitterness on her vivid lips.\\n\\n\\n\\'I suppose you have lots and lots of affairs in Cambridge, I told Irwin\\ncheerily, as I stuck a snail with a pin in one of Cambridge\\'s\\ndeterminedly French restaurants.\\n\\n\\'I seem,\\' Irwin admitted with a small, modest smile, \\'to get on with\\nthe ladies.\\'\\n\\nI picked up my empty snail shell and drank the herb-green juice.  I had\\nno idea if this was proper, but after months of wholesome, dull asylum\\ndiet, I was greedy for butter.\\n\\nI had called Doctor Nolan from a pay phone at the restaurant and asked\\nfor permission to stay overnight in Cambridge with Joan.  Of course, I\\nhad no idea whether Irwin would invite me back to his apartment after\\ndinner or not, but I thought his dismissal of the Slavic lady--another\\nprofessor\\'s wife--looked promising.\\n\\nI tipped back my head and poured down a glass of Nuits St. George.\\n\\n\\'You do like wine,\\' Irwin observed.\\n\\n\\'Only Nuits St. George.  I imagine him ... with the dragon...\\'\\n\\nIrwin reached for my hand.\\n\\nI felt the first man I slept with must be intelligent, so I would\\nrespect him.  Irwin was a full professor at twenty-six and had the\\npale, hairless skin of a boy genius.  I also needed somebody quite\\nexperienced to make up for my lack of it, and Irwin\\'s ladies reassured\\nme on this head.  Then, to be on the safe side, I wanted somebody I\\ndidn\\'t know and wouldn\\'t go on knowing--a kind of impersonal,\\npriestlike official, as in the tales of tribal rites.\\n\\nBy the end of the evening I had no doubts about Irwin whatsoever.\\n\\nEver since I\\'d learned about the corruption of Buddy Willard my\\nvirginity weighed like a millstone around my neck.  It had been of such\\nenormous importance to me for so long that my habit was to defend it at\\nall costs.  I had been defending it for five years and I was sick of it.\\n\\nIt was only as Irwin swung me into his arms, back at the apartment, and\\ncarried me, wine-dazed and limp, into the pitch-black bedroom, that I\\nmurmured, \\'You know, Irwin, I think I ought to tell you, I\\'m a virgin.\\'\\n\\nIrwin laughed and flung me down on the bed.\\n\\nA few minutes later an exclamation of surprise revealed that Irwin\\nhadn\\'t really believed me.  I thought how lucky it was I had started\\npractising birth control during the day, because in my winey state that\\nnight I would never have bothered to perform the delicate and necessary\\noperation.  I lay, rapt and naked, on Irwin\\'s rough blanket, waiting\\nfor the miraculous change to make itself felt.\\n\\nBut all I felt was a sharp, startlingly bad pain.\\n\\n\\'It hurts,\\' I said.  \\'Is it supposed to hurt?\\'\\n\\nIrwin didn\\'t say anything.  Then he said, \\'Sometimes it hurts.\\'\\n\\nAfter a little while Irwin got up and went into the bathroom, and I\\nheard the rushing of shower water.  I wasn\\'t sure if Irwin had done\\nwhat he planned to do, or if my virginity had obstructed him in some\\nway.  I wanted to ask him if I was still a virgin, but I felt too\\nunsettled.  A warm liquid was seeping out between my legs.\\nTentatively, I reached down and touched it.\\n\\nWhen I held my hand up to the light streaming in from the bathroom, my\\nfingertips looked black.\\n\\n\\'Irwin,\\' I said nervously, \\'bring me a towel.\\'\\n\\nIrwin strolled back, a bathtowel knotted around his waist, and tossed\\nme a second, smaller towel.  I pushed the towel between my legs and\\npulled it away almost immediately.  It was half black with blood.\\n\\n\\'I\\'m bleeding!\\' I announced, sitting up with a start.\\n\\n\\'Oh, that often happens,\\' Irwin reassured me.  \\'You\\'ll be all right.\\'\\n\\nThen the stories of blood-stained bridal sheets and capsules of red ink\\nbestowed on already deflowered brides floated back to me.  I wondered\\nhow much I would bleed, and lay down, nursing the towel.  It occurred\\nto me that the blood was my answer.  I couldn\\'t possibly be a virgin\\nany more.  I smiled into the dark.  I felt part of a great tradition.\\n\\nSurreptitiously, I applied a fresh section of white towel to my wound,\\nthinking that as soon as the bleeding stopped, I would take the late\\ntrolley back to the asylum.  I wanted to brood over my new condition in\\nperfect peace.  But the towel came away black and dripping.\\n\\n\\'I ... think I better go home,\\' I said faintly.\\n\\n\\'Surely not so soon.\\'\\n\\n\\'Yes, I think I better.\\'\\n\\nI asked if I could borrow Irwin\\'s towel and packed it between my thighs\\nas a bandage.  Then I pulled on my sweaty clothes.  Irwin offered to\\ndrive me home, but I didn\\'t see how I could let him drive me to the\\nasylum, so I dug in my pocketbook for Joan\\'s address.  Irwin knew the\\nstreet and went out to start the car.  I was too worried to tell him I\\nwas still bleeding.  I kept hoping every minute that it would stop.\\n\\nBut as Irwin drove me through the barren, snow-banked streets I felt\\nthe warm seepage let itself through the dam of the towel and my skirt\\nand on to the car seat.\\n\\nAs we slowed, cruising by house after lit house, I thought how\\nfortunate it was I had not discarded my virginity while living at\\ncollege or at home, where such concealment would have been impossible.\\n\\nJoan opened the door with an expression of glad surprise.  Irwin kissed\\nmy hand and told Joan to take good care of me.\\n\\nI shut the door and leaned back against it, feeling the blood drain\\nfrom my face in one spectacular flush.\\n\\n\\'Why, Esther,\\' Joan said, \\'what on earth\\'s the matter?\\'\\n\\nI wondered when Joan would notice the blood trickling down my legs and\\noozing, stickily, into each black patent leather shoe.  I thought I\\ncould be dying from a bullet wound and Joan would still stare through\\nme with her blank eyes, expecting me to ask for a cup of coffee and a\\nsandwich.\\n\\n\\'Is that nurse here?\\'\\n\\n\\'No, she\\'s on night duty at Caplan....\\'\\n\\n\\'Good.\\'  I made a little bitter grin as another soak of blood let\\nitself through the drenched padding and started the tedious journey\\ninto my shoes.  \\'I mean ... bad.\\'\\n\\n\\'You look funny,\\' Joan said.\\n\\n\\'You better get a doctor.\\'\\n\\n\\'Why?\\'\\n\\n\\'Quick.\\'\\n\\n\\'But...\\'\\n\\nStill she hadn\\'t noticed anything.\\n\\nI bent down, with a brief grunt, and slipped off one of my\\nwinter-cracked black Bloomingdale shoes.  I held the shoe up, before\\nJoan\\'s enlarged, pebbly eyes, tilted it, and watched her take in the\\nstream of blood that cascaded on to the beige rug.\\n\\n\\'My God!  What is it?\\'\\n\\n\\'I\\'m hæmorrhaging.\\'\\n\\nJoan half-led, half-dragged me to the sofa and made me lie down.  Then\\nshe propped some pillows under my blood-stained feet.  Then she stood\\nback and demanded, \\'Who was that man?\\'\\n\\nFor one crazy minute I thought Joan would refuse to call a doctor until\\nI confessed the whole story of my evening with Irwin and that after my\\nconfession she would still refuse, as a sort of punishment.  But then I\\nrealized that she honestly took my explanation at face value, that my\\ngoing to bed with Irwin was utterly incomprehensible to her, and his\\nappearance a mere prick to her pleasure at my arrival.\\n\\n\\'Oh somebody,\\' I said, with a flabby gesture of dismissal.  Another\\npulse of blood released itself and I contracted my stomach muscles in\\nalarm.  \\'Get a towel.\\'\\n\\nJoan went out and came back almost immediately with a pile of towels\\nand sheets.  Like a prompt nurse, she peeled back my blood-wet clothes,\\ndrew a quick breath as she arrived at the original royal red towel, and\\napplied a fresh bandage.  I lay, trying to slow the beating of my\\nheart, as every beat pushed forth another gush of blood.\\n\\nI remembered a worrisome course in the Victorian novel where woman\\nafter woman died, palely and nobly, in torrents of blood, after a\\ndifficult childbirth.  Perhaps Irwin had injured me in some awful,\\nobscure way, and all the while I lay there on Joan\\'s sofa I was really\\ndying.\\n\\nJoan pulled up an Indian hassock and began to dial down the long list\\nof Cambridge doctors.  The first number didn\\'t answer.  Joan began to\\nexplain my case to the second number, which did answer, but then broke\\noff and said \\'I see\\' and hung up.\\n\\n\\'What\\'s the trouble?\\'\\n\\n\\'He\\'ll only come for regular customers or emergencies.  It\\'s Sunday.\\'\\n\\nI tried to lift my arm and look at my watch, but my hand was a rock at\\nmy side and wouldn\\'t budge.  Sunday--the doctor\\'s paradise!  Doctors at\\ncountry clubs, doctors at the seaside, doctors with mistresses, doctors\\nwith wives, doctors in church, doctors in yachts, doctors everywhere\\nresolutely being people, not doctors.\\n\\n\\'For God\\'s sake,\\' I said, \\'tell them I\\'m an emergency.\\'\\n\\nThe third number didn\\'t answer and, at the fourth, the party hung up\\nthe minute Joan mentioned it was about a period.  Joan began to cry.\\n\\n\\'Look, Joan,\\' I said painstakingly, \\'call up the local hospital.  Tell\\nthem it\\'s an emergency.  They\\'ll have to take me.\\'\\n\\nJoan brightened and dialled a fifth number.  The Emergency Service\\npromised her a staff doctor would attend to me if I could come in to\\nthe ward.  Then Joan called a taxi.\\n\\nJoan insisted on riding with me.  I clasped my fresh padding of towels\\nwith a sort of desperation as the cabby, impressed by the address Joan\\ngave him, cut corner after corner in the dawn-pale streets and drew up\\nwith a great squeal of tyres at the Emergency Ward entrance.\\n\\nI left Joan to pay the driver and hurried into the empty, glaringly lit\\nroom.  A nurse bustled out from behind a white screen.  In a few swift\\nwords, I managed to tell her the truth about my predicament before Joan\\ncame in the door, blinking and wide-eyed as a myopic owl.\\n\\nThe Emergency Ward doctor strolled out then, and I climbed, with the\\nnurse\\'s help, on to the examining table.  The nurse whispered to the\\ndoctor, and the doctor nodded and began unpacking the bloody towelling.\\nI felt his fingers start to probe, and Joan stood, rigid as a soldier,\\nat my side, holding my hand, for my sake or hers I couldn\\'t tell.\\n\\n\\'Ouch!\\' I winced at a particularly bad jab.\\n\\nThe doctor whistled.\\n\\n\\'You\\'re one in a million.\\'\\n\\n\\'What do you mean?\\'\\n\\n\\'I mean it\\'s one in a million it happens to like this.\\'\\n\\nThe doctor spoke in a low, curt voice to the nurse, and she hurried to\\na side table and brought back some rolls of gauze and silver\\ninstruments.  \\'I can see,\\' the doctor bent down, \\'exactly where the\\ntrouble is coming from.\\'\\n\\n\\'But can you fix it?\\'\\n\\nThe doctor laughed.  \\'Oh, I can fix it, all right.\\'\\n\\n\\nI was roused by a tap on my door.  It was past midnight, and the asylum\\nquiet as death.  I couldn\\'t imagine who would still be up.\\n\\n\\'Come in!\\' I switched on the bedside light.\\n\\nThe door clicked open, and Doctor Quinn\\'s brisk, dark head appeared in\\nthe crack.  I looked at her with surprise, because although I knew who\\nshe was, and often passed her, with a brief nod, in the asylum hall, I\\nnever spoke to her at all.\\n\\nNow she said, \\'Miss Greenwood, may I come in a minute?\\'\\n\\nI nodded.\\n\\nDoctor Quinn stepped into the room, shutting the door quietly behind\\nher.  She was wearing one of her navy blue, immaculate suits with a\\nplain, snow-white blouse showing in the V of the neck.\\n\\n\\'I\\'m sorry to bother you, Miss Greenwood, and especially at this time\\nof night, but I thought you might be able to help us out about Joan.\\'\\n\\nFor a minute I wondered if Doctor Quinn was going to blame me for\\nJoan\\'s return to the asylum.  I still wasn\\'t sure how much Joan knew,\\nafter our trip to the Emergency Ward, but a few days later she had come\\nback to live in Belsize, retaining, however, the freest of town\\nprivileges.\\n\\n\\'I\\'ll do what I can,\\' I told Doctor Quinn.\\n\\nDoctor Quinn sat down on the edge of my bed with a grave face.  \\'We\\nwould like to find out where Joan is.  We thought you might have an\\nidea.\\'\\n\\nSuddenly I wanted to dissociate myself from Joan completely.  \\'I don\\'t\\nknow,\\' I said coldly.  \\'Isn\\'t she in her room?\\'\\n\\nIt was well after the Belsize curfew hour.\\n\\n\\'No, Joan had a permit to go to a movie in town this evening, and she\\'s\\nnot back yet.\\'\\n\\n\\'Who was she with?\\'\\n\\n\\'She was alone.\\'  Doctor Quinn paused.  \\'Have you any idea where she\\nmight be likely to spend the night?\\'\\n\\n\\'Surely she\\'ll be back.  Something must have held her up.\\'  But I\\ndidn\\'t see what could have held Joan up in tame night Boston.\\n\\nDoctor Quinn shook her head.  \\'The last trolley went by an hour ago.\\'\\n\\n\\'Maybe she\\'ll come back by taxi.\\'\\n\\nDoctor Quinn sighed.\\n\\n\\'Have you tried the Kennedy girl?\\' I went on.  \\'Where Joan used to\\nlive?\\'\\n\\nDoctor Quinn nodded.\\n\\n\\'Her family?\\'\\n\\n\\'Oh, she\\'d never go there ... but we\\'ve tried them, too.\\'\\n\\nDoctor Quinn lingered a minute, as if she could sniff out some clue in\\nthe still room.  Then she said, \\'Well, we\\'ll do what we can,\\' and left.\\n\\nI turned out the light and tried to drop back to sleep, but Joan\\'s face\\nfloated before me, bodiless and smiling, like the face of the Cheshire\\ncat.  I even thought I heard her voice, rustling and hushing through\\nthe dark, but then I realized it was only the night wind in the asylum\\ntrees....\\n\\nAnother tap woke me in the frost-grey dawn.\\n\\nThis time I opened the door myself.\\n\\nFacing me was Doctor Quinn.  She stood at attention, like a frail drill\\nsergeant, but her outlines seemed curiously smudged.\\n\\n\\'I thought you should know,\\' Doctor Quinn said.  \\'Joan has been found.\\'\\n\\nDoctor Quinn\\'s use of the passive slowed my blood.\\n\\n\\'Where?\\'\\n\\n\\'In the woods, by the frozen ponds....\\'\\n\\nI opened my mouth, but no words came out.\\n\\n\\'One of the orderlies found her,\\' Doctor Quinn continued, just now,\\ncoming to work....\\'\\n\\n\\'She\\'s not...\\'\\n\\n\\'Dead,\\' said Doctor Quinn.  \\'I\\'m afraid she\\'s hanged herself.\\'\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter Twenty\\n\\nA fresh fall of snow blanketed the asylum grounds--not a Christmas\\nsprinkle, but a man-high January deluge, the sort that snuffs out\\nschools and offices and churches, and leaves, for a day or more, a\\npure, blank sheet in place of memo pads, date books and calendars.\\n\\nIn a week, if I passed my interview with the board of doctors,\\nPhilomena Guinea\\'s large black car would drive me west and deposit me\\nat the wrought-iron gates of my college.\\n\\nThe heart of winter!\\n\\nMassachusetts would be sunk in a marble calm.  I pictured the\\nsnowflakey, Grandma Moses villages, the reaches of swampland rattling\\nwith dried cat-tails, the ponds where frog and hornpout dreamed in a\\nsheath of ice, and the shivering woods.\\n\\nBut under the deceptively clean and level slate the topography was the\\nsame, and instead of San Francisco or Europe or Mars I would be\\nlearning the old landscape, brook and hill and tree.  In one way it\\nseemed a small thing, starting, after a six months\\' lapse, where I had\\nso vehemently left off.\\n\\nEverybody would know about me, of course.\\n\\nDoctor Nolan had said, quite bluntly, that a lot of people would treat\\nme gingerly, or even avoid me, like a leper with a warning bell.  My\\nmother\\'s face floated to mind, a pale, reproachful moon, at her last\\nand first visit to the asylum since my twentieth birthday.  A daughter\\nin an asylum!  I had done that to her.  Still, she had obviously\\ndecided to forgive me.\\n\\n\\'We\\'ll take up where we left off, Esther,\\' she had said, with her\\nsweet, martyr\\'s smile.  \\'We\\'ll act as if all this were a bad dream.\\'\\n\\nA bad dream.\\n\\nTo the person in the bell jar, blank and stopped as a dead baby, the\\nworld itself is the bad dream.\\n\\nA bad dream.\\n\\nI remembered everything.\\n\\nI remembered the cadavers and Doreen and the story of the fig-tree and\\nMarco\\'s diamond and the sailor on the Common and Doctor Gordon\\'s\\nwall-eyed nurse and the broken thermometers and the negro with his two\\nkinds of beans and the twenty pounds I gained on insulin and the rock\\nthat bulged between sky and sea like a grey skull.\\n\\nMaybe forgetfulness, like a kind snow, should numb and cover them.\\n\\nBut they were part of me.  They were my landscape.\\n\\n\\n\\'A man to see you!\\'\\n\\nThe smiling, snow-capped nurse poked her head in through the door, and\\nfor a confused second I thought I really was back in college and this\\nspruce white furniture, this white view over trees and hills, an\\nimprovement on my old room\\'s nicked chairs and desk and outlook over\\nthe bald quad.  \\'A man to see you!\\' the girl on watch had said, on the\\ndormitory phone.\\n\\nWhat was there about us, in Belsize, so different from the girls\\nplaying bridge and gossiping and studying in the college to which I\\nwould return?  Those girls, too, sat under bell jars of a sort.\\n\\n\\'Come in!\\' I called, and Buddy Willard, khaki cap in hand, stepped into\\nthe room.\\n\\n\\'Well, Buddy,\\' I said.\\n\\n\\'Well, Esther.\\'\\n\\nWe stood there, looking at each other.  I waited for a touch of\\nemotion, the faintest glow.  Nothing.  Nothing but a great, amiable\\nboredom.  Buddy\\'s khaki-jacketed shape seemed small and unrelated to me\\nas the brown posts he had stood against that day a year ago, at the\\nbottom of the ski run.\\n\\n\\'How did you get here?\\' I asked finally.\\n\\n\\'Mother\\'s car.\\'\\n\\n\\'In all this snow?\\'\\n\\n\\'Well,\\' Buddy grinned, \\'I\\'m stuck outside in a drift.  The hill was too\\nmuch for me.  Is there anyplace I can borrow a shovel?\\'\\n\\n\\'We can get a shovel from one of the groundsmen.\\'\\n\\n\\'Good.\\'  Buddy turned to go.\\n\\n\\'Wait, I\\'ll come and help you.\\'\\n\\nBuddy looked at me then, and in his eyes I saw a flicker of\\nstrangeness--the same compound of curiosity and wariness I had seen in\\nthe eyes of the Christian Scientist and my old English teacher and the\\nUnitarian minister who used to visit me.\\n\\n\\'Oh, Buddy,\\' I laughed.  \\'I\\'m all right.\\'\\n\\n\\'Oh, I know, I know, Esther,\\' Buddy said hastily.\\n\\n\\'It\\'s you who oughtn\\'t to dig out cars, Buddy.  Not me.\\'\\n\\nAnd Buddy did let me do most of the work.\\n\\nThe car had skidded on the glassy hill up to the asylum and backed,\\nwith one wheel over the rim of the drive, into a steep drift.\\n\\nThe sun, emerged from its grey shrouds of cloud, shone with a summer\\nbrilliance on the untouched slopes.  Pausing in my work to overlook\\nthat pristine expanse, I felt the same profound thrill it gives me to\\nsee trees and grassland waist-high under flood water--as if the usual\\norder of the world had shifted slightly, and entered a new phase.\\n\\nI was grateful for the car and the snowdrift.  It kept Buddy from\\nasking me what I knew he was going to ask, and what he finally did ask,\\nin a low, nervous voice, at the Belsize afternoon tea.  DeeDee was\\neyeing us like an envious cat over the rim of her teacup.  After Joan\\'s\\ndeath, DeeDee had been moved to Wymark for a while, but now she was\\namong us once more.\\n\\n\\'I\\'ve been wondering ...\\'  Buddy set his cup in the saucer with an\\nawkward clatter.\\n\\n\\'What have you been wondering?\\'\\n\\n\\'I\\'ve been wondering ... I mean, I thought you might be able to tell me\\nsomething.\\'  Buddy met my eyes and I saw, for the first time, how he\\nhad changed.  Instead of the old, sure smile that flashed on easily and\\nfrequently as a photographer\\'s bulb, his face was grave, even\\ntentative--the face of a man who often does not get what he wants.\\n\\n\\'I\\'ll tell you if I can, Buddy.\\'\\n\\n\\'Do you think there\\'s something in me that _drives_ women crazy?\\'\\n\\nI couldn\\'t help myself, I burst out laughing--maybe because of the\\nseriousness of Buddy\\'s face and the common meaning of the word \\'crazy\\'\\nin a sentence like that.\\n\\n\\'I mean,\\' Buddy pushed on, \\'I dated Joan, and then you, and first you\\n... went, and then Joan...\\'\\n\\nWith one finger I nudged a cake crumb into a drop of wet, brown tea.\\n\\n\\'Of course you didn\\'t do it!\\' I heard Doctor Nolan say.  I had come to\\nher about Joan, and it was the only time I remember her sounding angry.\\n\\'Nobody did it!  _She_ did it!\\'  And then Doctor Nolan told me how the\\nbest of psychiatrists have suicides among their patients, and how they,\\nif anybody, should be held responsible, but how they, on the contrary,\\ndo not hold themselves responsible....\\n\\n\\'You had nothing to do with us, Buddy.\\'\\n\\n\\'You\\'re sure?\\'\\n\\n\\'Absolutely.\\'\\n\\n\\'Well,\\' Buddy breathed.  \\'I\\'m glad of that.\\'\\n\\nAnd he drained his tea like a tonic medicine.\\n\\n\\n\\'I hear you\\'re leaving us.\\'\\n\\nI fell into step beside Valerie in the little, nurse-supervised group.\\n\\'Only if the doctors say yes.  I have my interview tomorrow.\\'\\n\\nThe packed snow creaked underfoot, and everywhere I could hear a\\nmusical trickle and drip as the noon sun thawed icicles and snow crusts\\nthat would glaze again before nightfall.\\n\\nThe shadows of the massed black pines were lavender in that bright\\nlight, and I walked with Valerie a while, down the familiar labyrinth\\nof shovelled asylum paths.  Doctors and nurses and patients passing on\\nadjoining paths seemed to be moving on casters, cut off at the waist by\\nthe piled snow.  \\'Interviews!\\' Valerie snorted.  \\'They\\'re nothing!  If\\nthey\\'re going to let you out, they let you out.\\'\\n\\n\\'I hope so.\\'\\n\\nIn front of Caplan I said good-bye to Valerie\\'s calm, snow-maiden face\\nbehind which so little, bad or good, could happen, and walked on alone,\\nmy breath coming in white puffs even in that sun-filled air.  Valerie\\'s\\nlast, cheerful cry had been \\'So long!  Be seeing you.\\'\\n\\n\\'Not if I know it,\\' I thought.\\n\\nBut I wasn\\'t sure.  I wasn\\'t sure at all.  How did I know that\\nsomeday--at college, in Europe, somewhere, anywhere--the bell jar, with\\nits stifling distortions, wouldn\\'t descend again?\\n\\nAnd hadn\\'t Buddy said, as if to revenge himself for my digging out the\\ncar and his having to stand by, \\'I wonder who you\\'ll marry now, Esther.\\'\\n\\n\\'What?\\' I\\'d said, shovelling snow up on to a mound and blinking against\\nthe stinging back-shower of loose flakes.\\n\\n\\'I wonder who you\\'ll marry now, Esther.  Now you\\'ve been,\\' and Buddy\\'s\\ngesture encompassed the hill, the pines and the severe, snow-gabled\\nbuildings breaking up the rolling landscape, \\'here.\\'\\n\\nAnd of course I didn\\'t know who would marry me now that I\\'d been where\\nI had been.  I didn\\'t know at all.\\n\\n\\n\\'I have a bill here, Irwin.\\'\\n\\nI spoke quietly into the mouthpiece of the asylum pay phone in the main\\nhall of the administration building.  At first I suspected the\\noperator, at her switchboard, might be listening, but she just went on\\nplugging and unplugging her little tubes without batting an eye.\\n\\n\\'Yes,\\' Irwin said.\\n\\n\\'It\\'s a bill for twenty dollars for emergency attention on a certain\\ndate in December and a check-up a week thereafter.\\'\\n\\n\\'Yes,\\' Irwin said.\\n\\n\\'The hospital says they are sending me the bill because there was no\\nanswer to the bill they sent to you.\\'\\n\\n\\'All right, all right, I\\'m writing a cheque now.  I\\'m writing them a\\nblank cheque.\\'  Irwin\\'s voice altered subtly.  \\'When am I going to see\\nyou?\\'\\n\\n\\'Do you really want to know?\\'\\n\\n\\'Very much.\\'\\n\\n\\'Never,\\' I said, and hung up with a resolute click.\\n\\nI wondered, briefly, if Irwin would send his cheque to the hospital\\nafter that, and then I thought, \\'Of course he will, he\\'s a mathematics\\nprofessor--he won\\'t want to leave any loose ends.\\'\\n\\nI felt unaccountably weak-kneed and relieved.\\n\\nIrwin\\'s voice had meant nothing to me.\\n\\nThis was the first time, since our first and last meeting, that I had\\nspoken with him and, I was reasonably sure, it would be the last.\\nIrwin had absolutely no way of getting in touch with me, except by\\ngoing to Nurse Kennedy\\'s flat, and after Joan\\'s death Nurse Kennedy had\\nmoved somewhere else and left no trace.\\n\\nI was perfectly free.\\n\\n\\nJoan\\'s parents invited me to the funeral.\\n\\nI had been, Mrs Gilling said, one of Joan\\'s best friends.\\n\\n\\'You don\\'t have to go, you know,\\' Doctor Nolan told me.  \\'You can\\nalways write and say I said it would be better not to.\\'\\n\\n\\'I\\'ll go,\\' I said, and I did go, and all during the simple funeral\\nservice I wondered what I thought I was burying.\\n\\nAt the altar the coffin loomed in its snow-pallor of flowers--the black\\nshadow of something that wasn\\'t there.  The faces in the pews around me\\nwere waxen with candlelight, and pine boughs, left over from Christmas,\\nsent up a sepulchral incense in the cold air.\\n\\nBeside me, Jody\\'s cheeks bloomed like good apples, and here and there\\nin the little congregation I recognized other faces of other girls from\\ncollege and my home town who had known Joan.  DeeDee and Nurse Kennedy\\nbent their kerchiefed heads in a front pew.\\n\\nThen, behind the coffin and the flowers and the face of the minister\\nand the faces of the mourners, I saw the rolling lawns of our town\\ncemetery, knee-deep in snow now, with the tombstones rising out of it\\nlike smokeless chimneys.\\n\\nThere would be a black, six-foot deep gap hacked in the hard ground.\\nThat shadow would marry this shadow, and the peculiar, yellowish soil\\nof our locality seal the wound in the whiteness, and yet another\\nsnowfall erase the traces of newness in Joan\\'s grave.\\n\\nI took a deep breath and listened to the old brag of my heart.\\n\\nI am, I am, I am.\\n\\n\\nThe doctors were having their weekly board meeting--old business, new\\nbusiness, admissions, dismissals and interviews.  Leafing blindly\\nthrough a tatty _National Geographic_ in the asylum library, I waited\\nmy turn.\\n\\nPatients, with accompanying nurses, made their rounds of the stocked\\nshelves, conversing, in low tones, with the asylum librarian, an alumna\\nof the asylum herself.  Glancing at her--myopic, spinsterish,\\neffaced--I wondered how she knew she had really graduated at all, and,\\nunlike her clients, was whole and well.\\n\\n\\'Don\\'t be scared,\\' Doctor Nolan had said.  \\'I\\'ll be there, and the rest\\nof the doctors you know, and some visitors, and Doctor Vining, the head\\nof all the doctors, will ask you a few questions, and then you can go.\\'\\n\\nBut in spite of Doctor Nolan\\'s reassurances, I was scared to death.\\n\\nI had hoped, at my departure, I would feel sure and knowledgeable about\\neverything that lay ahead--after all, I had been \\'analyzed\\'.  Instead,\\nall I could see were question marks.\\n\\nI kept shooting impatient glances at the closed boardroom door.  My\\nstocking seams were straight, my black shoes cracked, but polished, and\\nmy red wool suit flamboyant as my plans.  Something old, something\\nnew....\\n\\nBut I wasn\\'t getting married.  There ought, I thought, to be a ritual\\nfor being born twice--patched, retreaded and approved for the road.  I\\nwas trying to think of an appropriate one when Doctor Nolan appeared\\nfrom nowhere and touched me on the shoulder.\\n\\n\\'All right, Esther.\\'\\n\\nI rose and followed her to the open door.\\n\\nPausing, for a brief breath, on the threshold, I saw the silver-baked\\ndoctor who had told me about the rivers and the Pilgrims on my first\\nday, and the pocked, cadaverous face of Miss Huey, and eyes I thought I\\nhad recognized over white masks.\\n\\nThe eyes and the faces all turned themselves towards me, and guiding\\nmyself by them, as by a magical thread, I stepped into the room.\\n'"
